accurate, useful, and safe outputs for a task, using patterns, examples, constraints, and evaluation to improve results." tabindex="0">Prompt engineering</a> matured from clever prompting tricks into a rigorous practice that blends pattern design, testing, and workflow governance. This playbook maps the terrain, from fundamentals and reusable templates to multimodal prompts and evaluation frameworks you can operationalize.</p><p>We will move through first principles into practical edge cases, with concrete examples, tradeoffs, and links to deeper guides for hands-on work. Use it as a hub to plan your own prompt library, experiment roadmap, and quality <a class="glossary-term" href="https://pulsegeek.com/glossary/guardrails/" data-tooltip="Rules, prompts, and checks that prevent unsafe, off-policy, or low-quality outputs, helping teams keep AI behavior compliant and consistent." tabindex="0">guardrails</a>.</p><h2 id="fundamentals-and-core-patterns" data-topic="foundations" data-summary="Essential patterns, system prompts, and dependable techniques for consistency.">Fundamentals and core patterns that make prompts reliable</h2><p>At the foundation of prompt engineering are a few structural moves that improve reliability across tasks: clarify the role and audience, constrain the output shape, provide representative examples, and state evaluation criteria. These moves are simple enough to memorize yet flexible enough to compose. For instance, a product-support chatbot can be steered with a role line, domain boundaries, and a JSON schema requirement that enforces fields like intent and confidence. The result is more predictable output and easier downstream parsing. Across real deployments, such as internal knowledge assistants, teams find that explicit structure reduces post-processing logic and shortens the distance between prototype and production.</p><p>System prompts deserve special attention because they shape behavior across the entire conversation. A durable <a class="glossary-term" href="https://pulsegeek.com/glossary/system-prompt/" data-tooltip="A high-priority instruction that sets role, tone, and boundaries for the model, shaping behavior across an entire conversation or workflow." tabindex="0">system prompt</a> defines capabilities and limits, calls out prohibited actions, and establishes tone. In enterprise pilots, small changes to these boundaries often shrink hallucination rates and reduce escalation to human agents. When you add clear instructions for uncertainty handling, such as when to ask for clarification, the model’s perceived helpfulness improves without additional token cost. Patterns that pair role clarity with schema constraints and examples consistently outperform ad hoc wording tweaks.</p><p>If you are new to the craft, start with a compact pattern kit and practice on a fixed test set. You can deepen your grasp with a primer on <a href="https://pulsegeek.com/articles/prompt-engineering-guide-core-patterns-system-prompts-and-reliable-techniques">core patterns, system prompts, and dependable techniques</a> that shows how to structure tasks for consistent results. To understand why the initial system message matters so much, study how system prompts set behavior, reduce drift, and improve consistency across sessions. For day-to-day composing, a practical walkthrough on <a href="https://pulsegeek.com/articles/how-to-write-effective-prompts-from-role-hints-to-output-constraints">writing with roles, constraints, examples, and evaluation tips</a> will help you move from intuition to repeatability.</p><p>As your skills grow, measure the tradeoffs between zero-shot and <a class="glossary-term" href="https://pulsegeek.com/glossary/few-shot-prompting/" data-tooltip="A technique that includes a few labeled examples in the prompt so the model can learn the task format and style, improving consistency and accuracy." tabindex="0">few-shot prompting</a>. Zero-shot is cheaper and simpler but can be brittle for nuanced classification. Few-shot improves control by showing the model precisely what good looks like, at the cost of tokens and curation time. When teams at content agencies standardize a handful of high-quality, representative examples, they often see variance drop across editors and shifts. A comparison of accuracy, controllability, and cost trade-offs will help you pick the right tool for the job.</p><h2 id="persona-and-marketing-templates" data-topic="personas" data-summary="Reusable templates for tone, structure, and search intent in marketing tasks.">Persona-driven templates for marketing that scale quality</h2><p>Marketing prompts benefit from explicit personas and tonal controls because brand voice and audience segment shape every sentence. A B2B cybersecurity buyer expects different vocabulary, proof points, and risk framing than a lifestyle consumer. Start by modeling your buyer personas with goals, pain points, and decision criteria, then translate those elements into prompt variables. Reusable templates can encode a house style, reading level, and preferred structure for assets like blog posts, emails, and product pages. This codifies “how we write” into shared building blocks that survive handoffs across teams and contractors.</p><p>The fastest route to leverage is a library of persona prompts with modular tone controls and SEO-ready structure. A dedicated guide to persona-based prompts for marketing with reusable templates, tone controls, and SEO-ready structures shows how to parameterize voice while keeping the skeleton of the content consistent. For long-form publishing, you can couple persona instructions with a content model for headings, internal linking, and entity coverage. To operationalize topic authority, follow a step-by-step approach to SEO content outlines using entities, headers, and internal linking plans, then reuse the outline as grounding for drafts.</p><p>Short-form assets need the same rigor. Teams running lifecycle campaigns can seed consistent voice by composing an intent-specific prompt for subject lines and CTAs, then testing variants. A resource with email prompt templates for subject lines, nurture sequences, and high-converting CTAs helps normalize approach across departments. For e-commerce, product copy benefits from attributes and benefits extraction, and schema hints to support rich results. Start with prompts that highlight attributes, benefits, and structured data hints to align copy with search intent and catalog structure.</p><p>Organizations that institutionalize these templates often integrate them into content briefs or CMS fields. Editorial leads can maintain a small library that encodes brand guidelines, saving time on rewrites and preserving consistency as the team scales. The payoff is cumulative: faster production, more coherent messaging, and a control surface for A/B tests that learn across campaigns.</p><h2 id="multimodal-text-image" data-topic="multimodal" data-summary="How to structure and evaluate prompts that combine text and images.">Multimodal prompts with text and images for consistent creative output</h2><p>Multimodal prompting blends narrative control with visual direction. When you prompt with text and reference images, you can guide composition, subject, lighting, and style with remarkable precision. Marketing teams use this to produce on-brand visuals for ads and landing pages, then iterate on variations while keeping core framing intact. The key is a structured prompt that separates subject, scene, camera or viewpoint, style cues, and constraints, plus explicit negatives to exclude unwanted elements. Consistency improves when you treat these parts like variables in a template rather than improvising each time.</p><p>To ground your approach, study a practitioner’s guide to <a href="https://pulsegeek.com/articles/multimodal-prompting-with-text-and-images-a-practitioners-guide-to-consistency">structure, styles, and reliability for text-and-image prompting</a>. It shows how to combine references and textual constraints to reduce drift across batches, which is especially important when producing seasonal ad sets. For text-to-image work, you can amplify control by using a catalog of modifiers. A deeper dive into <a href="https://pulsegeek.com/articles/prompt-modifiers-and-styles-for-images-a-catalog-of-aesthetics-and-lighting">aesthetics, lenses, lighting, and composition modifiers</a> will help you steer toward repeatable looks.</p><p>Brand consistency is a real-world constraint that requires careful prompting. Teams often maintain a palette, typography, and prop list and then encode these assets into their prompts. Explore techniques for <a href="https://pulsegeek.com/articles/how-to-prompt-for-brand-consistent-visuals-palettes-props-and-negative-prompts">brand-consistent image prompts with palettes and negative prompts</a> to avoid off-brand textures or distracting backgrounds. If your stakeholders need to choose among distinct creative directions, frame options via a comparison of <a href="https://pulsegeek.com/articles/comparison-of-text-to-image-prompt-styles-photorealism-vs-illustration-vs-3d">photorealism, illustration, and 3D styles for marketing use cases</a> to align expectations before production.</p><p>Adopting these methods is not just aesthetic. It affects operational throughput. When a growth team can reproduce a winning composition across sizes and placements, they can test messaging without redoing art direction each sprint. This is how high-performing teams ship creative that looks coherent in weekly cycles without burning out designers.</p><h2 id="reasoning-and-examples" data-topic="reasoning" data-summary="Patterns for stepwise reasoning and controlled generalization with examples.">Reasoning patterns and example-driven control</h2><p>Reasoning-heavy tasks such as troubleshooting, rubric grading, or data transformation benefit from structured thinking patterns. Chain-of-thought can help models unpack multi-step problems, but it should be used judiciously. It increases tokens and sometimes introduces verbose justifications where none are needed. In workflows where only the final answer is needed, you can keep internal reasoning hidden while still guiding steps. A guardrail is to ask for evidence in a compact format, like a bullet list of checks performed, rather than free-form essays.</p><p>When to use chain-of-thought depends on task complexity and error tolerance. For math proofs, policy analysis, or multi-constraint planning, inviting stepwise reasoning yields more complete outputs. A deeper read on <a href="https://pulsegeek.com/articles/chain-of-thought-prompting-pattern-when-to-use-it-and-how-to-guide-reasoning">when it works and how to structure reasoning</a> will help you calibrate. For generalization and style transfer, few-shot examples act as soft constraints. They show the model what to imitate without scripting every rule. A library of <a href="https://pulsegeek.com/articles/few-shot-prompting-examples-reusable-patterns-for-better-outputs">classification, style transfer, and structured output examples</a> accelerates onboarding and keeps teams from reinventing demonstrations for each project.</p><p>Examples are not just training wheels. They are levers for control. By curating edge cases in your few-shot set, you can bias the model away from common traps, such as conflating similar intents or over-expanding acronyms. In production support, teams often include “reject” exemplars that show how to say no when inputs fall outside policy. Many organizations also blend examples with schemas to produce structured outputs like CSV rows or API payloads. This pattern makes validation cheap and enables automated checks.</p><p>A practical tip: maintain a small, versioned bank of canonical examples for each task family. Label each example with what it teaches. When quality dips, you can quickly swap in sharper exemplars. Over time this repository becomes a shared language for reviewers and prompt authors, improving both speed and quality.</p><h2 id="context-and-rag" data-topic="grounding" data-summary="Use retrieval to ground answers in sources and reduce hallucinations.">Context grounding with retrieval to cut hallucinations</h2><p>Large language models are powerful pattern matchers but they do not inherently know your private data. Retrieval augmented generation adds a lookup step that fetches relevant snippets from a knowledge base, then passes these as context to the model. This approach reduces hallucinations and enables timely answers that reflect your latest docs or policies. Newsrooms, support teams, and internal wikis use retrieval to keep answers anchored in source material and to cite evidence. The mechanics matter: chunking, embedding choice, and the number of passages influence both accuracy and latency.</p><p><a class="glossary-term" href="https://pulsegeek.com/glossary/retrieval-augmented-generation/" data-tooltip="A technique that fetches relevant documents and adds them to the prompt, helping the model generate grounded, up-to-date, and verifiable responses." tabindex="0">RAG</a> shines when the cost of a wrong answer is high. Customer support assistants that cite specific policy text are more trustworthy and easier to audit. However, grounding is not a silver bullet. If your knowledge base is noisy or shallow, the model may still guess. A tactical guide to how retrieval adds context, reduces hallucinations, and where limits remain will help you design the right pipeline and guard against overconfidence. Consider fallback states too. When retrieval returns low-confidence matches, instruct the model to ask for clarification or route to search.</p><p>Real deployments balance quality and speed. For example, internal search at enterprises often sits behind access controls and varied metadata. Strong prompting includes instruction for citing source IDs and extracting answer spans rather than rewriting entire documents. Teams often add a verification step that compares the model’s claims against the retrieved passages. When the delta is large, they suppress answers or flag for review. These patterns make audit trails easy and build stakeholder confidence.</p><p>RAG also pairs nicely with structured outputs. Ask the model to return fields like answer, citations, and confidence, and you can power UIs that invite users to inspect sources. The result is a more transparent assistant that behaves less like an oracle and more like a research partner.</p><h2 id="evaluation-and-metrics" data-topic="evaluation" data-summary="Rubrics, test sets, and A/B methods for reliable prompt quality.">Evaluation playbook: rubrics, test sets, and experiments</h2><p>Without measurement, prompt engineering is guesswork. A robust evaluation program combines a clear rubric, a representative test set, and an experiment workflow. Start with outcomes that matter to your users, such as factual accuracy, adherence to format, or tone fit. Define observable criteria and scoring guidelines. For example, a three-point scale for citation accuracy might check whether claims are fully supported, partially supported, or unsupported. A resource on rubric examples, test datasets, and A/B testing workflows shows how to institutionalize this rigor.</p><p>Test sets require care. You want broad coverage, realistic edge cases, and defensible ground truth. Teams often mine logs for real queries, then redact sensitive data and label outcomes. This creates tests that reflect production mix rather than synthetic prompts. A practical guide to coverage, edge cases, and ground truth labels helps you avoid blind spots. Automated checks can accelerate iteration. Explore automated metrics for reasoning validity, safety, and format adherence to filter weak variants before human review.</p><p>Experiment design matters as much as metrics. State a specific hypothesis, control a single variable, and randomize assignment. When marketers test headline prompts, they often confound variables by changing both tone and structure. A clear walkthrough on hypotheses, metrics, and significance checks will help you make defensible decisions. For high-volume flows, you can mix periodic A/Bs with rolling quality gates that stop regressions from shipping.</p><p>Expect tradeoffs. Stricter constraints can improve format adherence while reducing creativity. Shorter prompts reduce cost but may raise variance. Capture these tensions in your rubric and make them explicit to stakeholders. Over time, evaluation becomes part of the culture. Product and editorial peers learn to discuss prompts in terms of error profiles and confidence rather than gut feel.</p><h2 id="workflow-chains-and-governance" data-topic="operations" data-summary="Reusable chains, orchestration, versioning, and governance checklists.">Workflow design: chaining, orchestration, and governance</h2><p>As prompt usage scales, single-shot prompts give way to multi-step chains. A chain decomposes a task into reliable stages, such as analysis, drafting, and QA. Each step uses a focused prompt and a structured handoff. This division of labor makes prompts simpler and easier to test, and it enables targeted retries when a step fails. Teams building editorial pipelines or customer support flows often see large quality gains by separating classification, generation, and validation rather than trying to do everything in one shot.</p><p>To operationalize this approach, use templates and checklists. A field guide to reusable chains, governance checklists, and versioning strategies shows how to encode best practices into repeatable assets. Orchestration platforms can help manage dependencies, caching, and observability across steps. When choosing a tool, compare features such as prompt registries, experiment tracking, and native evaluators. A survey of workflow orchestration tools and how to choose based on features and fit will save you from lock-in and brittle glue code.</p><p>Governance is not red tape. It is how you make prompt behavior legible and auditable. Version every prompt with a changelog, attach tests, and keep a living README with usage notes and known failure modes. A practical manual on versioning, tests, READMEs, and usage notes helps teams avoid tribal knowledge. As your library grows, build findability through taxonomy and metadata. A guide on prompt libraries with taxonomy, metadata, access controls, and change logs keeps your assets discoverable and safe.</p><p>In production, add circuit breakers and fallbacks. For example, if a validation step detects off-policy content, route to a safer model or a templated response while logging the incident. Over time, these operational muscles turn your prompt estate into a managed platform rather than a scattered collection of clever one-offs.</p><h2 id="safety-and-leakage" data-topic="safety" data-summary="Guardrails, policy conditioning, and leakage prevention patterns.">Safety guardrails and leakage prevention you can trust</h2><p>Safety in prompt engineering spans content filtering, policy conditioning, and <a class="glossary-term" href="https://pulsegeek.com/glossary/prompt-leakage/" data-tooltip="An information security risk where hidden instructions, system prompts, or proprietary context become exposed through outputs or attack prompts. It can harm safety, privacy, and competitive advantage." tabindex="0">prompt leakage</a> prevention. You want the model to avoid unsafe content and to resist revealing private instructions. Start by conditioning the model on your safety policy, including examples of disallowed and allowed responses. Then wrap generation with filters that screen for toxicity or sensitive attributes and trigger review when needed. Safety prompts are a design asset in their own right and deserve versioning and tests like any other component.</p><p>Leakage is a real risk, especially in tools that expose system messages or chain steps. Attackers can use injection tactics to coax internal instructions or private data from the model. Understanding leakage risks and prevention patterns with red-teaming and guardrails helps you recognize common failure modes. Defense in depth pairs content policy conditioning with pattern filters and sandboxed tools. When a prompt calls external APIs, scope permissions minimally and audit logs for misuse.</p><p>Operational guardrails evolve with usage. Start with a baseline filter and expand as real incidents arise. For instance, after a burst of jailbreak attempts in public chat interfaces, teams added stricter instruction hierarchy and reinforced refusal patterns with explicit escalation language. A best-practices digest on filters, policies, and safe overrides can accelerate your setup. The goal is not to block creativity but to keep outputs within policy while preserving utility.</p><p>Set expectations with stakeholders. No single filter eliminates risk, and false positives can frustrate users. Build feedback paths for overrides and tune thresholds with metrics. Over time, guardrails become a competitive advantage because they enable faster iteration with less firefighting.</p><h2 id="code-and-tool-use" data-topic="engineering" data-summary="Constraints, tests, and reviews for safe code generation.">Prompting for code generation and tool use</h2><p>Code generation is a high-leverage use case that demands strong safeguards. Prompts should define language, target environment, and constraints like dependency policies or performance budgets. Pair outputs with test scaffolds so that correctness is measurable. Developers at many organizations run generated code against unit tests before any human review. This reduces reviewer load and catches regressions early. When the model proposes shell commands or migration scripts, require a dry-run preview and explicit confirmation steps.</p><p>Effective prompts act like detailed tickets with acceptance criteria. They include examples of correct function signatures and failure cases. They also name prohibited patterns such as hard-coded secrets or network calls in tests. A safety-first guide to constraints, tests, and review checklists to reduce risk outlines a pragmatic setup. For teams that use tools like code assistants, add policy-aware disclaimers and instructions for referencing canonical libraries rather than inventing utilities.</p><p>Tool use goes beyond code. When the model is allowed to call calculators, search, or internal services, prompts should specify allowed tools, when to use them, and how to format results. Logging tool calls and inputs creates an audit trail. In regulated environments, this is essential for incident response and compliance. Over time you can refine prompts through error analyses, documenting tool-specific failure modes and adding heuristics for safer fallbacks.</p><p>Production examples abound. Public discussions around code assistants show strong gains in developer velocity when prompts are explicit about quality gates. Organizations that treat prompts as code, with versioning and tests, are the ones who sustain those gains without spikes in rework.</p><h2 id="pattern-catalog" data-topic="catalog" data-summary="Reusable templates with roles, constraints, and structure.">Reusable pattern catalog: roles, constraints, and structure</h2><p>A pattern catalog transforms scattered expertise into a living system. Organize patterns by task family, such as classification, extraction, drafting, summarization, and critique. Each pattern should state objective, inputs, constraints, and output schema. Include a compact rationale that explains when to use the pattern and what it trades off. For instance, a critique pattern might emphasize argumentative completeness over brevity, which is right for editorial review but wrong for social copy. This clarity helps practitioners pick the right tool and anticipate side effects.</p><p>Patterns are stronger with tested templates. Pair each with a few parameterized variants and examples. For example, a structured summarization pattern can support expert audiences by preserving technical terms while simplifying clauses. Add a variant for executive briefings that compresses to bullets with recommendations. Over time, your catalog becomes a library of best bets. For newcomers, it compresses the learning curve by showing how experts think about constraints and schemas rather than just clever phrasing.</p><p>To maintain quality, link patterns to evaluation and governance. Each entry should reference its rubric and test set. When a change ships, rerun tests and update the changelog. This is where workflow assets tie together. Your catalog references the earlier guides to <a href="https://pulsegeek.com/articles/prompt-engineering-guide-core-patterns-system-prompts-and-reliable-techniques">fundamental patterns and system prompts</a> and the operations material on reusable chains and versioning. The catalog then serves as a launchpad for teams to assemble project-specific workflows quickly and safely.</p><p>Finally, expose the catalog through your internal tools. Whether in a wiki or an orchestration platform, make patterns searchable by tags like domain, audience, or output type. Add lightweight request flows so practitioners can propose new patterns with embedded tests. This keeps the library current and encourages shared ownership.</p><h2 id="quick-compare-table" data-topic="comparison" data-summary="Side-by-side view of prompting approaches and tradeoffs.">Quick comparison of prompting approaches and their tradeoffs</h2><p>Choosing the right prompting approach depends on accuracy needs, cost budget, and control requirements. The table below summarizes common options and where they fit. Use it as a starting point to select your baseline and identify when to graduate to more structured workflows.</p><table><thead><tr><th>Approach</th><th>Best For</th><th>Strengths</th><th>Limitations</th><th>Operational Notes</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>Zero-shot</td><td>Simple drafting and brainstorming</td><td>Low cost, fast setup</td><td>Brittle on nuance, variable tone</td><td>Pair with basic format constraints</td></tr><tr><td>Few-shot</td><td>Style transfer, classification</td><td>Higher control, clearer intent</td><td>Token cost, curation effort</td><td>Maintain canonical example sets</td></tr><tr><td>Chain-of-thought</td><td>Multi-step reasoning</td><td>Better completeness</td><td>Longer outputs, leakage risk</td><td>Hide reasoning, request compact evidence</td></tr><tr><td>RAG</td><td>Grounded answers, citations</td><td>Reduced hallucinations</td><td>Needs quality corpus</td><td>Tune chunking and passage count</td></tr><tr><td>Chained workflow</td><td>Production pipelines</td><td>Composable, testable steps</td><td>More moving parts</td><td>Use orchestration and version control</td></tr></tbody></table><p>Start with the simplest approach that meets your goal. Add structure only when you can articulate a quality or reliability gap. This protects both budget and momentum while keeping room for controlled improvement.</p><h2 id="where-to-begin" data-topic="roadmap" data-summary="Actionable first steps and an iterative improvement plan.">A practical roadmap for your next quarter</h2><p>The quickest path to impact is to pick one high-value workflow and harden it end to end. Choose a task with clear success criteria and a steady stream of inputs, such as drafting support responses or generating research summaries. Build a compact pattern with role, constraints, and schema. Add two or three canonical examples. Then instrument it with a small rubric and a test set. You will learn more in two weeks of measured iteration than in a month of unchecked experimentation.</p><p>As you stabilize quality, design a minimal chain that separates analysis from generation and validation. Introduce retrieval if your domain relies on current facts or internal policy. Wrap the flow with safety prompts and filters that reflect your environment. Store the assets in a simple registry with versioning and changelogs. This gives you an operational base to scale.</p><p>During the quarter, schedule regular experiment cycles. Use A/B tests to compare prompt variants against your baseline. Track not just outcome metrics but operational signals such as average review time or escalation rate. This is where the earlier material on rubrics, test sets, and A/B workflows pays off. When a variant wins, promote it and update the documentation so the entire team benefits.</p><p>Finally, keep an eye on adjacent opportunities. If marketing templates are humming, expand into multimodal campaigns with the guide to <a href="https://pulsegeek.com/articles/multimodal-prompting-with-text-and-images-a-practitioners-guide-to-consistency">consistent text-and-image prompting</a>. If engineering is the bottleneck, shore up practices for safe code-generation prompting. With each step, your organization moves from improvisation to a disciplined system that compounds learning and quality.</p><h2 id="looking-ahead" data-topic="outlook" data-summary="Emerging capabilities and how to future-proof your prompt practice.">What’s next and how to stay ready</h2><p>Model capabilities will keep evolving, but the fundamentals in this playbook travel well. Strong role definitions, explicit constraints, and measurable evaluation will remain useful even as context windows grow and tools improve. Retrieval will become more native in platforms, yet it will still depend on clean sources and careful prompting. Multimodal models will expand what we can control in images, audio, and video, which makes pattern libraries and brand guardrails even more valuable.</p><p>Expect tighter integration with orchestration and analytics. As vendors standardize prompt registries and experiment tracking, it will be easier to share baselines and reproduce results. Teams that invest now in governance, versioning, and a shared catalog will adopt new features faster. The goal is to turn prompts into dependable building blocks that your colleagues can trust and improve.</p><p>The most resilient organizations will treat prompt engineering like product management for language. They will define user outcomes, run structured experiments, and publish learnings. Use the sections and linked resources in this hub to build that muscle. With a small set of reliable patterns and a steady evaluation cadence, you can ship higher-quality work in shorter cycles and stay ahead as the field moves.</p><section id="article-glossary" class="article-glossary" aria-labelledby="article-glossary-heading"><h2 id="article-glossary-heading">Key terms</h2><ul class="article-glossary-list"><li><a href="https://pulsegeek.com/glossary/few-shot-prompting/">Few-Shot Prompting</a><span class="def"> — A technique that includes a few labeled examples in the prompt so the model can learn the task format and style, improving consistency and accuracy.</span></li><li><a href="https://pulsegeek.com/glossary/guardrails/">Guardrails</a><span class="def"> — Rules, prompts, and checks that prevent unsafe, off-policy, or low-quality outputs, helping teams keep AI behavior compliant and consistent.</span></li><li><a href="https://pulsegeek.com/glossary/prompt-engineering/">Prompt Engineering</a><span class="def"> — The practice of designing inputs that guide AI models to produce accurate, useful, and safe outputs for a task, using patterns, examples, constraints, and evaluation to improve results.</span></li><li><a href="https://pulsegeek.com/glossary/prompt-leakage/">Prompt Leakage</a><span class="def"> — An information security risk where hidden instructions, system prompts, or proprietary context become exposed through outputs or attack prompts.
