operations. The most effective programs translate signals into predictable actions across buildings, industry, and homes. Below are the top use cases that utilities and aggregators scale first because they deliver measurable peak relief, verifiable savings, and strong customer experiences.</p><p>As you scan, note where advanced metering, clear communications, and standards-based integration accelerate outcomes. Each item flags practical steps and tradeoffs so you can stage pilots with confidence and scale with fewer surprises.</p><section class="pg-listicle-item"><h2 id="hvac-and-chillers-ci" data-topic="use-case" data-summary="HVAC and chiller flexibility for C&amp;I with AMI and automation">1) C&amp;I HVAC and Chillers: Pre-cool, Stage, and Ride Through Peaks</h2><p>Large HVAC and central chiller plants are the workhorses of commercial and institutional demand response. Pre-cooling during shoulder periods and staged setpoint adjustments during peaks can trim hundreds of kilowatts per site without discomfort when sequences are tuned. Facilities like hospitals, universities, and data-intensive offices often pair air-side economizers with thermal inertia to glide through critical hours while maintaining indoor air quality and comfort metrics. Programs in places like Singapore’s Smart Nation initiatives have shown how building automation systems, when integrated with utility signals, can deliver repeatable, verifiable curtailment events.</p><p>The operational recipe is straightforward but detail-heavy. Start with baseline audits, occupancy patterns, and thermal mass assessments. Layer in <a class="glossary-term" href="https://pulsegeek.com/glossary/advanced-metering-infrastructure/" data-tooltip="A networked metering system with smart meters, communications, headend, and data management that enables interval data collection, remote control, outage detection, and integration with demand response and pricing programs." tabindex="0">AMI</a> interval data to pinpoint load inflection points, then design control strategies that pre-cool or pre-condition zones ahead of events. OpenADR or vendor APIs can translate dispatch calls into building automation logic that sequences chillers, pumps, fans, and VAV boxes. Continuous commissioning closes the loop, ensuring persistence across seasons and retrofits. For new builds, specifying metering at the plant and air-handler level unlocks better diagnostics and higher confidence in measured savings.</p><p>Success depends on communications cadence and measurement rules. Customers need early signals, event countdowns, and post-event feedback tied to comfort and cost. Utilities benefit when M&amp;V aligns with how buildings actually operate, accounting for weather and occupancy. Reference architectures that coordinate AMI, DRMS, and BAS streamline deployment and testing, reducing site-by-site friction. For a deeper planning blueprint, see the utility-facing resource on <a href="https://pulsegeek.com/articles/advanced-metering-infrastructure-deployment-plan-architecture-rollout-and-change-management">Comprehensive AMI deployment planning: architecture, communications, rollout, integration, and change management.</a></p><ul><li>Best targets: campuses, healthcare, data-heavy offices, convention centers.</li><li>Tactics: pre-cool, chiller staging, static pressure tweaks, supply-air resets.</li><li>Watchouts: humidity control, critical zones, reheat penalties, occupant messaging.</li></ul></section><ol><li>Integrate BAS with DRMS using OpenADR or vendor-certified adapters.</li><li>Define event playbooks: pre-event, ramp, sustain, recovery, and M&amp;V windows.</li><li>Use AMI data to verify baselines and refine persistence by season.</li></ol><section class="pg-listicle-item"><h2 id="industrial-process-and-thermal" data-topic="use-case" data-summary="Industrial load shifting with process controls and thermal storage">2) Industrial Processes and Thermal Storage: Shift, Store, and Stabilize</h2><p>Industrial sites concentrate flexible load in processes with buffers or storage. Batch production lines, water and wastewater pumping, and cold storage can shift hours without quality loss when controls and inventory policies are aligned. Cold warehouses often leverage thermal flywheels, overcooling before a peak and coasting during events while maintaining product safety. Municipal water systems, citing examples from Barcelona’s smart city programs, schedule pumping to off-peak periods while keeping reservoir levels within operational bands.</p><p>Thermal storage is an equalizer. Ice tanks and phase-change materials absorb cooling loads overnight, releasing capacity during peak windows. In food logistics, advanced defrost scheduling and staggered compressor dispatch reduce coincident peaks across multi-evaporator racks. Digital twins of process sequences help planners test DR scenarios, ensuring throughput and quality hold steady. When industrial controllers expose setpoints and schedules through secure gateways, DR signals can modulate loads in fine steps rather than crude on/off blocks, which improves comfort for operators and reduces restart risks.</p><p>The <a class="glossary-term" href="https://pulsegeek.com/glossary/use-case/" data-tooltip="A defined business problem where AI can deliver value." tabindex="0">business case</a> improves with transparent incentives and clear M&amp;V. Programs that compensate for both capacity and performance entice facilities to automate rather than rely on manual overrides. Utilities should pair enrollment support with communications that explain safety, quality, and restart procedures. Interoperable architectures reduce integration lift across vendor ecosystems. For grid-facing design patterns, consult <a href="https://pulsegeek.com/articles/smart-grid-integration-architectures-der-ami-v2g-and-interoperability-for-urban-utilities">A complete guide to smart grid integration across DER, AMI, V2G, and standards for urban utilities seeking scalable, interoperable architectures.</a></p><ul><li>Prime candidates: cold storage, wastewater pumping, cement grinding, batch lines.</li><li>Enablers: secure gateways, process buffers, thermal storage, digital twins.</li><li>Risks: product integrity, restart surges, labor impacts, controller lockouts.</li></ul></section><ol><li>Map processes by flexibility class and buffer duration.</li><li>Quantify thermal capacity and safe drift limits with conservative guardrails.</li><li>Automate dispatch to avoid missed events and operator fatigue.</li></ol><section class="pg-listicle-item"><h2 id="residential-thermostats-ev-water-heaters" data-topic="use-case" data-summary="Residential thermostats, EV charging, and water heaters for DR">3) Residential Smart Thermostats, EV Charging, and Water Heaters: Automate the Everyday</h2><p>Residential flexibility scales through participation numbers. Smart thermostats deliver fast, predictable response when utilities segment customers and set comfort bands that respect local climates. Programs in California often pair thermostat events with public Flex Alert messaging so households understand the why behind a setpoint nudge. Managed charging for EVs shifts large evening peaks into overnight valleys, especially when drivers enroll in scheduled or price-triggered charging. Heat pump and resistance water heaters, with built-in controls, absorb daytime solar or pause briefly in critical hours without noticeable hot water impacts.</p><p>Success hinges on accessible pricing signals and crisp user experience. AMI-enabled time-of-use and critical peak messages help households anticipate events, not just react. Device ecosystems differ, so standardizing event payloads and testing end-to-end flows reduces opt-outs. Equity matters. Offering no-cost devices in underserved communities, plus clear opt-out controls, builds trust and spreads benefits. Aggregators can blend devices into virtual power plants that dispatch at feeder granularity for local constraints.</p><p>Utilities should align messaging with standards and design patterns that customers can understand at a glance. Clear dashboards, countdown timers, and after-action feedback reduce confusion and raise satisfaction. If you are shaping the communications layer, consider the guidance on <a href="https://pulsegeek.com/articles/time-of-use-pricing-communication-via-ami-messaging-standards-and-customer-ux">how utilities communicate TOU pricing via AMI with standards, messaging strategies, and UX considerations</a>.

In commercial settings, storage paired with solar shaves demand charges and delivers dispatchable kW during critical windows. Residential batteries, orchestrated as virtual power plants, can respond in seconds and sustain across multi-hour peaks. Programs in Australia and parts of the United States have shown how coordinated battery fleets stabilize feeders with high PV penetration, absorbing midday excess and supporting evening ramps.</p><p>The integration stack matters. DRMS must coordinate with <a class="glossary-term" href="https://pulsegeek.com/glossary/distributed-energy-resource-management-system/" data-tooltip="A software platform that monitors, forecasts, and controls distributed energy resources at scale, coordinating inverter settings, demand response, and market participation while meeting feeder constraints and grid reliability goals." tabindex="0">DERMS</a> or aggregator platforms, align telemetry, and reconcile M&amp;V so resources are not double-counted. Interoperability through IEEE and IEC profiles, plus OpenADR and Sunspec where applicable, reduces vendor lock-in. AMI data remains crucial for settlement and equity checks, ensuring customers are credited fairly and events are verifiable. Feeder-aware dispatch helps utilities solve local constraints rather than blunt system peaks alone.</p><p>Design for customer value first. C&amp;I customers often optimize around demand charges and resilience, so programs that stack incentives with backup priorities gain traction. Households value bill savings, outage support, and transparent control windows. Clear enrollment flows, device health monitoring, and seasonal playbooks keep fleets reliable.
