This guide unpacks twelve gotchas that repeatedly appear in audits, from reentrancy and arithmetic faults to signature validation slips and brittle oracles. You will learn actionable defenses that map to how blockchains verify identity and authorize transactions. Where cryptography matters, we connect the dots to identity and authorization concepts so you can reason about risk with more confidence. Along the way, you will see how safeguards like checks effects interactions, nonces, replay protection, and access patterns reduce surprise. If you want a broader cryptography primer, read the tour of hashes, signatures, and proofs that secure transactions end to end in our article on <a href="https://pulsegeek.com/articles/blockchain-cryptography-core-hashes-keys-and-proofs">how blockchain cryptography secures the transaction lifecycle</a>.</p><section class="pg-summary-block pg-key-takeaways" role="note" aria-label="Key takeaways"><h2>Key takeaways</h2><ul><li><a class="glossary-term" href="https://pulsegeek.com/glossary/reentrancy/" data-tooltip="Reentrancy is a vulnerability where a contract’s external call lets another contract call back before state updates finish, enabling repeated withdrawals or logic misuse." tabindex="0">Reentrancy</a> thrives on external calls before state changes occur.</li><li>Arithmetic overflows still surface when assumptions about ranges break.</li><li>Signature checks fail without domain separation and strict encoding.</li><li><a class="glossary-term" href="https://pulsegeek.com/glossary/oracle/" data-tooltip="An oracle supplies off-chain data to on-chain contracts, such as prices or weather.

The classic defense is the checks effects interactions pattern, which validates inputs, updates internal state, then makes external calls. A pull payment pattern further reduces blast radius by letting users withdraw later from a ledger. Using a reentrancy guard with a simple mutex also helps when functions span multiple external calls. The tradeoff is reduced composability, because you delay or split interactions. Still, when handling ether or tokens, favor internal accounting first and external transfers last. That ordering short-circuits the attacker’s ability to re-call the function while funds still appear available.</p><p>A practical example is a withdraw function that transfers ether before decrementing the user’s balance. An attacker’s fallback function can call withdraw again in the same transaction, repeating until the contract’s balance hits zero. To prevent this, zero the balance before transferring and consider using call with a gas stipend and success check. On ERC20 transfers, always inspect the returned boolean when available and handle failure explicitly. The why is simple. State changes shield the contract from stale accounting while explicit checks prevent silent failure paths attackers can chain together. When interaction is necessary, wrap it in a minimal scope with guards and clear failure handling.</p><p>Developers sometimes assume that nonReentrant modifiers cover all cases, but nested calls across different functions can still create windows. Be careful with functions that call each other and share the same guard, because reentrancy between guarded and unguarded paths can bypass intent. Also review cross-contract callbacks that trigger lifecycle hooks, including ERC777 tokens with send hooks and ERC721 receiver checks. When uncertainty remains, design with pull patterns and throttle withdrawals by limiting per-block or per-transaction amounts. These constraints impose user friction, but they buy you time to react if an exploit begins. The principle is to reduce simultaneous exposure while keeping legitimate flows workable.</p><div class="pg-section-summary" data-for="#reentrancy-unexpected-recursion" role="note" aria-label="Section summary"><h3 class="summary-title">Section highlights</h3><ul class="mini"><li>Update internal state before any external interaction to block recursion.</li><li>Prefer pull payments and guards to minimize simultaneous exposure.</li></ul></div></section><section class="pg-listicle-item"><h2 id="arithmetic-overflow-underflow" data-topic="Arithmetic" data-summary="Bound math and validate ranges to stay safe">2) Arithmetic surprises: overflow, underflow, and bad assumptions</h2><p>Arithmetic mistakes happen when developers assume values stay in comfortable ranges. Even with <a class="glossary-term" href="https://pulsegeek.com/glossary/solidity/" data-tooltip="Solidity is a programming language for writing smart contracts, mainly on EVM-compatible blockchains. It looks like JavaScript and adds features for blockchain data, events, and access control." tabindex="0">Solidity</a> 0.8 checked math, logic can depend on modular wraparound or ignore division truncation, producing silent value shifts. Always constrain inputs with require checks and validate invariants after computations. For token math, use unit tests that fuzz around boundaries like zero, max supply, and rate multipliers. If you rely on multiplication before division, consider using scaling factors and rounding rules to avoid truncation bias. These guardrails do not eliminate complexity, but they turn surprises into explicitly handled cases. The goal is to keep every numeric path within a known, bounded envelope that your tests actually cover.</p><p>Consider reward calculations that multiply balances by a rate then divide by a denominator. If the intermediate product overflows before division in older compilers or libraries, the result becomes garbage. In Solidity 0.8, you get a revert, which can still become a griefing vector if an attacker manipulates input ranges to trigger consistent failure. To mitigate, cap inputs before expensive math and prefer safe casting patterns when moving between integer sizes. For fixed point operations, use a battle-tested math library with clear rounding direction. The why is to reduce implicit assumptions while making error conditions explicit and predictable for users.</p><p>Time arithmetic is another frequent source of bugs. Developers assume block.timestamp increments monotonically and by a known step, but miners can shift timestamps within reasonable bounds. When vesting or auctions depend on time, include grace windows and avoid tight equality checks. For rate limits, prefer block numbers for deterministic spacing or accept timestamp jitter by widening thresholds. Always test edge cases 1 second before and after your deadlines. These measures trade precision for resilience. They recognize that the chain provides approximate time, not a wall clock, and adjust logic so small drifts do not unlock or freeze funds unexpectedly.</p><div class="pg-section-summary" data-for="#arithmetic-overflow-underflow" role="note" aria-label="Section summary"><h3 class="summary-title">Section highlights</h3><ul class="mini"><li>Constrain inputs and define rounding to avoid numeric surprises.</li><li>Treat timestamps as approximate and test boundary conditions.</li></ul></div></section><section class="pg-listicle-item"><h2 id="signature-validation-mistakes" data-topic="Signatures" data-summary="Verify signer, domain, and intent rigorously">3) Signature validation mistakes: who signed what and for which domain</h2><p>Signature checks prove authority only if they bind the right message, domain, and nonce. Common mistakes include recovering the wrong signer due to nonstandard encodings or omitting domain separation so a message valid in one contract authorizes in another. Always use EIP-712 typed data where possible and include chain ID, contract address, and function intent in the domain. Add unique nonces or usage counters so each signature authorizes exactly one action. These additions require more client logic, but they drastically reduce replay risk and cross-contract confusion. The target is not just valid math, but unambiguous intent tied to a single context and moment.</p><p>Another failure mode is malleability and ambiguity. If you accept both 65-byte and compact signatures, normalize them before recovery and reject strange v values or s ranges outside the lower half order as recommended by Ethereum’s guidelines. When building permit flows for ERC20 approvals, require the current nonce and a deadline and verify that the signer matches the expected owner address. These checks reduce space for adversaries to craft signatures that the wallet never intended. The tradeoff is stricter clients and more explicit error messages, which is a price worth paying for clarity and auditability.</p><p>If signature security is new territory, anchor your mental model in how digital signatures prove identity and authorize blockchain transactions. A clear primer on key formats, binding, and validation flows will help you reason about what your contract should accept and why. For that foundation, see this overview of <a href="https://pulsegeek.com/articles/digital-signatures-in-blockchain-verify-and-authorize">how digital signatures prove identity and authorize on-chain actions</a>. It outlines the mechanics that your verification code depends on, and it highlights why domain separation and nonces turn cryptography into reliable policy. With that background, your contract validation rules become easier to justify and test.</p><div class="pg-section-summary" data-for="#signature-validation-mistakes" role="note" aria-label="Section summary"><h3 class="summary-title">Section highlights</h3><ul class="mini"><li>Bind signatures to domain, chain, nonce, and explicit intent.</li><li>Normalize encodings and enforce strict ranges to avoid ambiguity.</li></ul></div></section><section class="pg-listicle-item"><h2 id="access-control-gaps" data-topic="Access control" data-summary="Harden roles, ownership, and emergency powers">4) Access control gaps: unclear ownership and overpowered admins</h2><p>Access control fails when roles are vague, centralized, or silently inherited. Define explicit roles for minting, pausing, upgrading, and treasury actions. Use a standard role framework so revocation and enumeration are straightforward during audits. Multisig wallets for admin actions provide resilience, but only if member keys are independent and stored with different threat profiles. Include a delay for critical changes so stakeholders can react. The tradeoff is slower governance and more coordination. That is acceptable for high risk controls, while routine operations can remain streamlined. The aim is to make who can do what crystal clear so surprises do not surface during incidents.</p><p>Ownership transfers and renouncements can also introduce downtime or unintended loss of control. Always implement two-step ownership transfers with pending owner acceptance to prevent accidental loss. When pausing or emergency stop mechanisms exist, constrain their scope and duration and publish transparent criteria for activation. Avoid god functions that bypass all checks without events, because incident response needs a trail. Consider separating upgrade authority from treasury control so a single compromised role cannot push malicious code and drain funds in one move. These design choices convert latent superpowers into bounded, observable actions.</p><p>External dependencies complicate permission boundaries. If a contract reads from an oracle or uses a router, ask which role can change those addresses and how quickly. A short, uncontrolled update path can redirect flows to attacker controlled components even when your internal roles are strict. Add timelocks and monitoring on configuration changes and rotate dependencies through allowlists. The tradeoff is operational overhead, but the payback is a predictable surface where changes are visible, reversible, and rate limited. Harden the edges, not just the core, because most high impact failures ride through configuration pivots instead of direct function calls.</p><div class="pg-section-summary" data-for="#access-control-gaps" role="note" aria-label="Section summary"><h3 class="summary-title">Section highlights</h3><ul class="mini"><li>Define explicit roles with delays and separation of powers.</li><li>Constrain configuration changes with timelocks and monitoring.</li></ul></div></section><section class="pg-listicle-item"><h2 id="unchecked-external-calls" data-topic="External calls" data-summary="Check outcomes and plan for failure modes">5) Unchecked external calls: silent failures and unexpected behavior</h2><p>External calls can fail, succeed unexpectedly, or return crafted data. If you ignore return values from token transfers or low level calls, your contract may assume state changed when it did not. Always verify success flags and expected data shapes. Prefer interfaces with explicit return types and revert on failure rather than swallowing errors. When interacting with arbitrary tokens, handle nonstandard ERC20 implementations by wrapping calls and normalizing outcomes. This adds code, but it centralizes assumptions and gives you one chokepoint for policy. The effect is fewer edge cases leaking into business logic, where they are harder to reason about and test.</p><p>Low level calls using call, delegatecall, or staticcall need strict guardrails. Delegatecall changes storage in the caller’s context, so use it only with audited libraries and fixed code hashes. Staticcall forbids state changes, which is useful for view operations but cannot enforce remote discipline. When in doubt, design for pull rather than push. Return data length checks prevent crafted responses from being interpreted as successful when they are not. The why is to make every cross-contract interaction explicit about success, failure, and mutation so attackers cannot smuggle state changes through unexpected control flow.</p><p>Design graceful failure paths for integrations you do not control. If a token transfer fails, consider crediting a receivable and allowing later retries, or pause only the affected feature instead of halting the entire contract. Bound retries and set timeouts so malicious partners cannot lock your system in a failure loop. The tradeoff is more states to manage, but that is better than emergency only toggles. By planning for partial failure upfront, your contract can degrade predictably under stress rather than amplifying a small integration hiccup into a full outage.</p><div class="pg-section-summary" data-for="#unchecked-external-calls" role="note" aria-label="Section summary"><h3 class="summary-title">Section highlights</h3><ul class="mini"><li>Always verify return values and normalize nonstandard token behavior.</li><li>Design pull patterns and bounded retries for resilient integrations.</li></ul></div></section><section class="pg-listicle-item"><h2 id="oracle-design-risks" data-topic="Oracles" data-summary="Constrain trust and react to anomalies">6) Oracle pitfalls: brittle feeds and unbounded trust</h2><p>Oracle design fails when a single data source or unbounded updater controls critical decisions. Use aggregation across multiple independent sources and require a quorum that matches your risk tolerance. Add staleness checks and maximum drift constraints so outdated values do not move markets or liquidations. When possible, implement circuit breakers that pause sensitive actions if volatility exceeds a threshold within a measurement window. These choices introduce false positives during sharp but legitimate moves, yet they protect users from outliers and manipulation. The goal is to bound trust and make price sensitive paths fail safe under uncertainty rather than fail open.</p><p>On-chain price references from automated market makers can be manipulated within one transaction using flash loans. To mitigate, rely on time-weighted averages over multiple blocks and cap how much a single update can change effective prices. For lending or collateralization, compare multiple signals and require agreement before action. This redundancy costs gas and may delay reactions to real market changes, but it reduces the influence of single-block distortions. By favoring inertia and consensus over immediate sharp moves, you trade speed for safety in the parts of the system that decide who keeps or loses collateral.</p><p>Operational hygiene matters as much as math. Protect oracle updaters with strong keys, process isolation, and monitoring that alerts on unusual patterns like repeated minimal updates or bursts at odd intervals. Document the failover plan and practice it so you can switch feeds under pressure. Record every update with an event schema that downstream systems can parse easily during incidents. These noncode controls do not eliminate manipulation risk, but they compress detection and response time. They acknowledge that data is a supply chain, not a constant, and design the contract to be robust when that supply chain gets noisy.</p><div class="pg-section-summary" data-for="#oracle-design-risks" role="note" aria-label="Section summary"><h3 class="summary-title">Section highlights</h3><ul class="mini"><li>Aggregate sources and enforce staleness and drift constraints on feeds.</li><li>Favor time-weighted data and circuit breakers for price sensitive paths.</li></ul></div></section><section class="pg-listicle-item"><h2 id="upgradeability-hazards" data-topic="Upgradeability" data-summary="Preserve storage and gate deployment changes">7) Upgrade hazards: storage layout and proxy missteps</h2><p>Upgradeability introduces new failure modes when storage layouts drift or initializers run twice. In proxy patterns, the implementation’s storage must match the proxy’s layout exactly. Adding variables in the middle of structs or reordering slots corrupts state silently. Use storage gaps and append-only patterns, and document each release’s layout. Protect initializers with versioned modifiers so they cannot be called again. Gate upgrades behind a timelock and require a test deployment that migrates real state in a staging environment. The cost is heavier process, but it is cheaper than recovering from corrupted balances or permanent configuration loss.</p><p>Delegatecall based proxies blur permissions. If an attacker can force your proxy to delegatecall into an untrusted implementation, they can mutate storage as the proxy. Restrict upgrade mechanisms to vetted code hashes and prevent implementation self destruct where possible. Emit events for every upgrade and include the new code’s version and hash so off-chain monitors can verify. Consider adding an emergency rollback slot that can point to the last known good implementation with a separate, tightly controlled role. This safety valve slows attackers who exploit upgrade paths by requiring them to maintain control through multiple checkpoints.</p><p>Testing must cover storage invariants across versions. Snapshot critical slots before and after upgrades and compare. Fuzz test initialization paths so race conditions in construction do not reappear with reinitializers. Simulate pausing and unpausing around upgrades to ensure no partial states trap user funds. These tests take time, but they convert unknown unknowns into explicit checks you can monitor. Combined with process controls and event <a class="glossary-term" href="https://pulsegeek.com/glossary/monitoring/" data-tooltip="Tracking system health and performance over time." tabindex="0">observability</a>, they make upgrades boring. Boring is the target condition for code that custodies assets and routes value between parties with different incentives and time horizons.</p><div class="pg-section-summary" data-for="#upgradeability-hazards" role="note" aria-label="Section summary"><h3 class="summary-title">Section highlights</h3><ul class="mini"><li>Use append-only storage layouts and protect initializers with versions.</li><li>Timelock and monitor upgrades with hashes and rollback options.</li></ul></div></section><section class="pg-listicle-item"><h2 id="front-running-and-mev" data-topic="MEV" data-summary="Reduce exploitable ordering dependencies">8) Front running and MEV: adversarial ordering games</h2><p>Public mempools expose transactions to searchers who reorder or sandwich them for profit. Contracts that depend on exact ordering or immediately exploitable price movements invite loss. Use commit reveal flows to hide sensitive parameters until settlement, and add slippage bounds or price checks on trades. Batch auctions or frequent batch auctions reduce price discrimination by clearing many orders together at a single price. These designs introduce delay and user friction, but they transform predictable losses into optional latency. The principle is to deny adversaries the ability to react to parameters before they are final.</p><p>Some actions cannot be hidden completely. For liquidations or arbitrage, you can reduce extractable value by charging protocol fees that return value to long term users, or by using Dutch auctions that decay prices rather than relying on a single first past the post race. Add minimum viable delays that give off-chain keepers fair access rather than rewarding only the fastest bundle submitter. These choices do not eliminate MEV, but they narrow the gap between inside and outside actors. They aim for equitable outcomes instead of fragile first come dynamics.</p><p>Private transaction relays and builder channels can reduce exposure, but they create trust and liveness assumptions. If a private relay censors or fails, your users may be stuck. Offer both public and private paths and detect failures quickly. For applications where fairness matters more than instant settlement, consider periodic clearing oracles that publish results at set intervals. That cadence reduces timing games and makes strategy about participation rather than sniping. You are shaping incentives so adversaries cannot cheaply extract value at the expense of regular participants.</p><div class="pg-section-summary" data-for="#front-running-and-mev" role="note" aria-label="Section summary"><h3 class="summary-title">Section highlights</h3><ul class="mini"><li>Hide or batch sensitive parameters to blunt ordering attacks.</li><li>Offer private relays with fallbacks and fairness minded settlement.</li></ul></div></section><section class="pg-listicle-item"><h2 id="randomness-and-entropy" data-topic="Randomness" data-summary="Use verifiable randomness, not block data">9) Randomness pitfalls: predictable seeds and miner influence</h2><p>Using blockhash or timestamp for <a class="glossary-term" href="https://pulsegeek.com/glossary/entropy/" data-tooltip="Entropy measures uncertainty in data. Systems need strong entropy to generate keys, seeds, and random numbers that attackers cannot predict or reproduce." tabindex="0">randomness</a> lets miners or validators bias outcomes. For lotteries or NFT traits, predictable seeds enable targeted reorgs or bribes. Use verifiable randomness beacons that produce proofs and commit reveal schemes that separate commitment from reveal across blocks. Add deadlines and fallback logic if reveals do not arrive. These steps increase complexity and settle times, but they transform randomness from a hint to a verifiable resource. The why is to remove cheap bias and make attacks require visible coordination rather than opportunistic selection of miner influenced fields.</p><p>In commit reveal patterns, ensure the commitment binds all relevant parameters including sender, salt, and intended action. If commitments are malleable or do not include the final target, attackers can reuse them across contexts. For allocation systems, record commitments on-chain and randomize the reveal order to minimize last mover advantage. If you support cancellations, burn the commitment or mark it as spent so it cannot authorize anything later. These mechanics do not make entropy larger, but they ensure that whatever entropy you have does not leak through side channels.</p><p>When connecting to a randomness oracle, budget for delays and fee variability. Handle skipped or failed callbacks by retrying within a bounded window and expiring requests that go stale. Expose events with request IDs and results so external watchers can validate delivery. Keep sensitive logic behind state flags so nothing acts on unverifiable randomness. You are encoding the idea that randomness is a service with constraints, not a free function, and that robust consumption patterns matter as much as the generator’s cryptographic properties.</p><div class="pg-section-summary" data-for="#randomness-and-entropy" role="note" aria-label="Section summary"><h3 class="summary-title">Section highlights</h3><ul class="mini"><li>Avoid block data and prefer verifiable randomness or commit reveal.</li><li>Bind commitments fully and handle oracle delays predictably.</li></ul></div></section><section class="pg-listicle-item"><h2 id="initialization-and-constructors" data-topic="Initialization" data-summary="Lock setup paths and validate invariants">10) Initialization gotchas: uninitialized state and constructor quirks</h2><p>Contracts that are not initialized properly can be hijacked. In proxy patterns, constructors on the implementation do not run, so you must provide an initializer and protect it with an onlyInitializing style modifier and a once only guard. Set all critical variables, including admin addresses, token parameters, and immutable like values where appropriate. Emit events that document setup for audits. The cost is careful choreography across deployment scripts, but this is the moment where ownership and authorization crystallize. A missed assignment here becomes a permanent footgun that no later patch can safely unwind.</p><p>Be aware of delegatecall during initialization. If your initializer calls external contracts that depend on msg.sender or storage assumptions, results can diverge between implementation and proxy contexts. Keep initializers short and self contained and avoid interacting with untrusted addresses. Validate invariants at the end, such as total supply equals initial distribution and role counts match expectations. These explicit checks compile your assumptions into code that fails loudly when deployment deviates from plan. It is better to stop early than to limp forward with a broken foundation.</p><p>Also mind default values. Booleans default to false and addresses to zero, which can accidentally pass require checks if you inverted a condition or forgot to set a sentinel. Create explicit state enums for lifecycle phases like Uninitialized, Active, and Paused, and switch only once the initializer completes. Tests should deploy fresh instances and attempt to call setup twice to ensure the guard holds. The benefit is clear observability during deployment and less ambiguity during audits, where reviewers can track a simple state machine rather than infer intent from a tangle of flags.</p><div class="pg-section-summary" data-for="#initialization-and-constructors" role="note" aria-label="Section summary"><h3 class="summary-title">Section highlights</h3><ul class="mini"><li>Use explicit initializers with once only guards and event trails.</li><li>Keep setup self contained and verify invariants before activation.</li></ul></div></section><section class="pg-listicle-item"><h2 id="token-standards-and-assumptions" data-topic="Tokens" data-summary="Normalize behavior across token variants">11) Token standard assumptions: ERC variants that surprise callers</h2><p>Not all tokens behave the same. Some ERC20 variants do not return booleans on transfer, while others revert on failure. ERC777 adds hooks that execute code on send, which can reenter naive receivers. ERC721 safe transfers call onERC721Received on the destination, which can contain arbitrary logic. To stay safe, wrap token interactions in libraries that normalize outcomes and apply reentrancy guards around receipt hooks. Maintain allowlists for tokens with known quirks and test against them. This adds integration effort, but it creates a common abstraction boundary that your core logic can rely on.</p><p>Beware of fee on transfer and rebasing tokens. If you assume a transfer of X yields exactly X on the receiver, accounting will drift when tokens skim fees or adjust balances over time. When dealing with these assets, measure balance before and after operations and use deltas rather than assumed amounts. For collateral, apply buffers and liquidation margins that account for supply changes. These strategies trade simplicity for correctness in ecosystems where token behavior evolves independently of your code. Your goal is to reflect reality, not a text book standard that few tokens match perfectly.</p><p>Metadata and decimals also vary. Do not rely on decimals to be 18 or names to be unique. Fetch and cache these fields defensively and sanitize them for display. For math, treat decimal places as configuration rather than a constant. Tests should cover extreme decimals like 0 and 27 to ensure your scaling logic works. These defensive practices make your interface resilient and your accounting consistent across a wide spectrum of assets. They respect that token standards are conventions with living exceptions rather than guarantees etched in stone.</p><div class="pg-section-summary" data-for="#token-standards-and-assumptions" role="note" aria-label="Section summary"><h3 class="summary-title">Section highlights</h3><ul class="mini"><li>Wrap token calls to normalize outcomes and guard receipt hooks.</li><li>Account by balance deltas to handle fees and rebases safely.</li></ul></div></section><section class="pg-listicle-item"><h2 id="key-management-and-admin" data-topic="Key management" data-summary="Harden keys that move or gate assets">12) Key management mistakes: the real control plane</h2><p>Smart contracts encode policy, but keys execute it. If deployer or admin keys are weak, shared, or reused, attackers bypass on-chain checks entirely. Use hardware backed wallets for high impact roles and split control across independent operators with multisignature policies. Require geographic and device diversity to avoid single environmental failures. Document recovery processes and simulate them quarterly. The friction of ceremony prevents rushed, risky actions during crises. It also clarifies who can act, when, and under what constraints, turning key handling into an explicit control system rather than a convenience function.</p><p>Do not let signatures become a soft spot. Authorize actions with nonces and expiry and scope them to a specific contract and chain. Rotate keys that sign off-chain messages used for oracles or relays and track their use. If a key appears in unexpected contexts, treat it as compromised and rotate immediately. The why is straightforward. Cryptographic strength means little if a single piece of plastic or a copied seed phrase can move all funds without resistance. Redundancy and oversight translate math into durable governance.</p><p>Finally, align key policy with protocol risk. Treasury movements, parameter changes, and upgrades deserve slower paths with timelocks and wide sign-off. Routine tasks like fee sweeps can live behind smaller quorums with spend limits. Monitor all admin actions with alerts and public dashboards so the community can verify behavior. These choices integrate operational security with technical design, acknowledging that authorization is a continuous process.
