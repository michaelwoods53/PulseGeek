The standards behind bidirectional charging are the rails that make scale possible, but they can feel like parallel tracks. This guide orients you to the ecosystem and then walks the route from policies to plug.</p><p>We start broad and then descend into how OCPP, ISO 15118, IEEE 2030.5, and grid codes interact across fleets, buildings, and distribution systems. Expect grounded advice, tradeoffs, and patterns you can reuse in projects this year.</p><h2 id="v2g-standards-landscape" data-topic="overview" data-summary="Maps the end-to-end V2G standards stack and roles.">The V2G standards landscape: who speaks to whom, and why it matters</h2><p>The current V2G stack spans three conversational layers. Vehicle-to-charger uses ISO 15118 for high-trust features like Plug and Charge and negotiated power profiles. Charger-to-backend relies on OCPP to orchestrate sessions, events, and smart charging logic across thousands of ports. Grid-facing coordination flows through utility or aggregator interfaces that often use IEEE 2030.5, OpenADR, or proprietary APIs to turn price and constraint signals into control. Each layer solves different problems and should only shoulder what it can do reliably. When boundaries blur, projects tangle in edge cases and rework.</p><p>Real-world deployments show how these roles play out. In California’s EPIC-supported pilots and programs like Charge Ready Transport, fleets use OCPP-enabled charge management with site controllers, while utilities standardize on IEEE 2030.5 for distributed energy resource telemetry and dispatch. In Europe, public charging blends ISO 15118 with e-roaming via OCPI and back-office control through OCPP, while grid constraints surface via national codes and DSO APIs. Singapore’s Smart Nation initiatives demonstrate government-led coordination, aligning cybersecurity baselines with smart charging objectives to avoid fragmented vendor stacks.</p><p>Interoperability is not an abstract ideal. It limits vendor risk, unlocks competitive procurement, and keeps control strategies portable as your fleet grows from 20 to 2,000 vehicles. The most resilient programs create an internal RACI: ISO 15118 handles identity, metering at the EVSE or vehicle, and power profile negotiation. OCPP supervises sessions, heartbeats, and fault handling. IEEE 2030.5 or utility protocols convey constraints, events, and verification. The rest—like tariff logic, market bidding, or prediction—belongs in your EMS or aggregator platform, not hardcoded in devices.</p><p>Before diving deeper, bookmark broader architecture context. For a systems-level foundation across DER, AMI, and charging, see this <a href="https://michaelwoods53.github.io/PulseGeek/articles/smart-grid-integration-architectures-der-ami-v2g-and-interoperability-for-urban-utilities">complete guide to smart grid integration across DER, AMI, V2G, and standards for urban utilities seeking scalable, interoperable architectures</a>. Keeping that map in mind helps right-size each standard’s role and avoids hidden coupling.</p><h2 id="ocpp-in-practice" data-topic="protocols" data-summary="How OCPP enables large-scale, vendor-neutral charging control.">OCPP in practice: orchestration, events, and bidirectional readiness</h2><p>Open Charge Point Protocol is the workhorse between chargers and management systems. OCPP 1.6 remains widespread, with Smart Charging profiles enabling power caps per connector, station, or site. OCPP 2.0.1 expands the model with improved device management, security events, and native energy transfer accounting. For V2G, the key is not whether OCPP can reverse power flow but whether it can schedule, meter, and monitor sessions while upstream logic directs when to discharge. In most architectures, the EMS or aggregator computes the plan, then dispatches limits to the CSMS via OCPP. The charger enforces, reports meter values, and translates faults into actionable events.</p><p>Bidirectional pilots from bus depots in the UK to light-duty fleets in the Netherlands show patterns worth repeating. Use OCPP to set time-sliced limits and to request granular meter values at short intervals when discharging. Pair that with watchdogs: a missed heartbeat should fail safe to charge-only or disconnect. Map fault codes to operator playbooks, prioritizing contactor welds, ground fault, and overtemperature. Also, explicitly test connector-type behavior, because CHAdeMO V2G, CCS with ISO 15118-20 DC, and emerging AC V2G have different fast-paths for error recovery and session teardown.</p><p>Security posture matters. Enforce TLS with mutual authentication between charger and CSMS and rotate certificates on a schedule. For multi-tenant sites, partition assets by organization in the CSMS and ensure that firmware update jobs include rollback criteria and power fail tolerance. Finally, get comfortable with vendor diversity. You will likely run different charger makes across sites. A focused comparison of how OCPP and ISO 15118 divide responsibilities can help with product selection; see this analysis of <a href="https://michaelwoods53.github.io/PulseGeek/articles/ocpp-vs-iso-15118-communication-plug-and-charge-and-smart-charging-compared">communication scope, Plug-and-Charge, certificates, and use cases</a> for tradeoffs that show up in RFPs.</p><p>Expect gaps at the edges. For example, energy market telemetry might be too slow in OCPP for frequency response, so do not push subsecond controls through it. Conversely, device inventory and configuration are well supported. Keep OCPP for what it does best: reliable supervision at scale, neutral to utility programs and markets.</p><h2 id="iso-15118-foundations" data-topic="vehicle-communications" data-summary="Identity, Plug and Charge, and V2G negotiation with ISO 15118.">ISO 15118 foundations: identity, Plug and Charge, and negotiated power profiles</h2><p>ISO 15118 brings a rich contract and security model to the cable. With Plug and Charge, vehicles authenticate using certificates issued by a public key infrastructure, removing driver apps and RFID cards for many use cases. That same trust fabric enables secure data exchange and lays groundwork for energy transfer certificates that a future settlement process can rely on. With ISO 15118-20, the standard expands into bidirectional DC and AC, power scheduling, and load balancing that can align with site constraints. Think of it as the vehicle-facing brain that can understand and negotiate complex charging intentions.</p><p>However, ISO 15118 is not a silver bullet. It excels at per-vehicle identity, session setup, and fine-grained charging behavior. It does not replace fleet-wide optimization or utility dispatch. Projects in Germany’s publicly funded programs and vendor-neutral test events like CharIN testivals repeatedly show the need for end-to-end certificate lifecycle operations, from issuing provisioning certificates to handling revocation and renewal. Operationally, teams must plan for what happens if certificate validation fails at 2 a.m. in a depot. Clear fallbacks, such as defaulting to contract-based PnC or secure RFID, keep vehicles moving.</p><p>Compliance testing is crucial. Pre-qualify vehicles and chargers against the same 15118 profiles. Document which options are mandatory for your scenario, such as External Identification Means for mixed-driver environments, and which are optional. Maintain a matrix of OEMs, firmware versions, and supported features, and retest after every significant update. For a quick refresher on physical power paths and converters that underlie these capabilities, cross-check with this explainer on <a href="https://michaelwoods53.github.io/PulseGeek/articles/how-does-bidirectional-charging-work-power-flow-converters-and-use-cases">bidirectional charging with AC/DC architectures, converters, power flow, and utility use cases</a> to ensure your team pairs standards with the right hardware.</p><p>Finally, align ISO 15118 features with your customer experience. Plug and Charge reduces friction at public sites. In depots, the bigger win may be high-reliability session setup and richer telemetry that improves maintenance. When evaluating vendors, request demonstrations of certificate enrollment, renewal under network loss, and recovery from mid-session interruptions to see how theory holds up under operational stress.</p><h2 id="ieee-2030-5-utility-edge" data-topic="grid-integration" data-summary="IEEE 2030.5 for DER telemetry, dispatch, and utility programs.">IEEE 2030.5 at the utility edge: telemetry, dispatch, and verification</h2><p>IEEE 2030.5, also known as SEP 2.0, is a common choice for utility-to-aggregator or utility-to-site communications where distributed energy resources must be visible and controllable. It models resources as functions, supports event-driven control, and encodes telemetry and capabilities in a standardized way. California’s Rule 21 and related DER programs elevated 2030.5 in inverter-based solar and storage, and its influence is spreading to EV charging as fleets present grid-scale loads and sources. For V2G, 2030.5 can convey charging constraints, curtailment, and even pricing signals that site systems translate into per-connector limits via OCPP.</p><p>Utilities value verifiability. IEEE 2030.5 supports measurement feedback that confirms whether a resource honored a command, which is essential for settlement and program compliance. In practice, a site controller or aggregator aggregates multiple EVSEs and exposes a virtual DER that the utility can dispatch. Consider a school bus V2G project participating in evening peak shaving: the utility issues a load reduction event, the site controller redistributes limits to selected buses, and 2030.5 provides event status and achieved kW back to the utility. This reduces uncertainty compared with opaque proprietary APIs.</p><p>Adoption requires integration effort. Your EMS must translate 2030.5 events into actionable schedules across heterogeneous chargers and vehicles. Latency, firewall policies, and certificate management all matter. Cybersecurity baselines from NISTIR 7628 and ISA/IEC 62443 offer patterns for protecting the OT/IT boundary. When evaluating market and program participation via aggregation, also review business and regulatory implications in this overview of <a href="https://michaelwoods53.github.io/PulseGeek/articles/v2g-aggregator-business-models-revenue-stacks-and-regulatory-paths">revenue stacking, value streams, and regulatory considerations</a>. The better you model commitments and telemetry pathways, the more bankable your revenue becomes.</p><p>Some regions prefer OpenADR for price and event signaling. That can work, but you will still need a device-level or site-level standard to turn those signals into physical schedules. 2030.5 remains a strong choice when utilities require device or site telemetry and continuous verification.</p><h2 id="grid-codes-interconnection" data-topic="policy" data-summary="Grid codes, protection, metering, and V2G interconnection steps.">Grid codes and interconnection: protection, metering, and tariffs for V2G</h2><p>Standards inside the fence matter only if the interconnection outside the fence is sound. Grid codes and interconnection rules govern safety, protection, power quality, and market participation. In North America, IEEE 1547-2018 defines interconnection and interoperability for DER, while local tariffs and handbooks set meter placement, demand charges, and export eligibility. In Europe, ENTSO-E guidance and national codes specify frequency and voltage ride-through, reactive capability, and telemetry. For V2G, the differences between charge-only and export-capable interconnections are substantial. You must address anti-islanding, export limits, and protection coordination with the utility early.</p><p>Project teams succeed when they separate five workstreams: electrical design, protection studies, metering and settlement, interconnection application, and customer rate strategy. Each has dependencies. For example, if you plan to export, the metering package may require bi-directional revenue-grade meters and transformer loss compensation. Protective device settings must consider reverse power flow. Utilities will ask about failure modes during discharge, including stuck relays and grid loss. Build a strong application with one-line diagrams, relay coordination, and test plans that cover both charge and discharge regimes.</p><p>From a planning perspective, utilities are catching up. To navigate evolving requirements, use this utility-focused guide on <a href="https://michaelwoods53.github.io/PulseGeek/articles/how-to-plan-v2g-interconnection-for-utilities-protection-metering-and-tariffs">protection, metering, tariffs, and standards for V2G interconnections</a>. On the customer side, rate selection can make or break a business case. Demand charges and export compensation vary widely. Some pilots carve special riders for V2G school buses or depot fleets to test impacts on evening peaks. Where programs are immature, non-export strategies like behind-the-meter peak shaving or feeder constraint relief can still yield savings without export complexity.</p><p>Keep an eye on real-world reforms. California’s ongoing tariff revisions for DER and Europe’s flexibility market developments suggest a future where EV flexibility earns more granular payments. Build optionality into your design so you can pivot from non-export to export when programs mature without rewiring the site.</p><h2 id="standards-comparison" data-topic="value-comparison" data-summary="Side-by-side view of OCPP, ISO 15118, and IEEE 2030.5.">How the standards fit together: a side-by-side comparison</h2><p>Choosing where to put specific functions is easier with a clear comparison. The table below aligns scope, primary users, security model, and best-fit use cases. Use it to sanity-check RFP language and avoid asking one protocol to do two other protocols’ jobs. This mapping also helps your cybersecurity team decide where to anchor certificate authorities and how to separate trusted zones.</p><p>Notice that ISO 15118 lives at the vehicle edge with high-trust identity and session control, OCPP governs device fleets, and IEEE 2030.5 bridges programmatic grid interactions. When you design a system that respects these boundaries, upgrades become incremental rather than invasive. For instance, you can swap a charger vendor while preserving your headend and utility program integrations.</p><table><thead><tr><th>Standard</th><th>Primary Scope</th><th>Typical Endpoint Pair</th><th>Security Model</th><th>Best-Fit Use Cases</th><th>Known Limitations</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>OCPP 1.6/2.0.1</td><td>Charger management and sessions</td><td>EVSE to CSMS</td><td>TLS, optional client certs, role-based control</td><td>Fleet-scale supervision, firmware, fault handling, smart charging</td><td>Not a utility dispatch protocol, limited subsecond control</td></tr><tr><td>ISO 15118-2/-20</td><td>Vehicle identity and power negotiation</td><td>EV to EVSE</td><td>PKI-backed Plug and Charge, contract certificates</td><td>PnC, secure session setup, V2G scheduling at the cable</td><td>Does not replace fleet optimization or program interfaces</td></tr><tr><td>IEEE 2030.5</td><td>DER telemetry and control</td><td>Utility or Aggregator to Site/DER</td><td>Certificate-based, event-driven control</td><td>Utility programs, verification, market dispatch</td><td>Requires translation to device-level protocols like OCPP</td></tr></tbody></table><p>When drafting contracts, require vendors to demonstrate end-to-end flows across these layers. Ask for a test that starts with a utility event, passes through your EMS, and concludes with metered response at an EV. Capture logs from all three protocols. This not only validates interoperability but also gives your operations team a playbook for incident triage.</p><h2 id="operations-load-management" data-topic="setup-guide" data-summary="Operational strategies for EV load and discharge scheduling.">Operational strategies: EV load management and discharge scheduling at scale</h2><p>Operations is where standards earn their keep. Start with a clear hierarchy of control: program and price signals shape site-level targets, which your EMS converts to connector setpoints, while ISO 15118 refines per-vehicle charging plans. For depots, the scheduler must respect route readiness and battery health first, then monetize spare capacity. A practical approach is to lock readiness windows for priority vehicles and allow others to participate in discharge events. Use OCPP meter values and SoC where available, and build predictive buffers for vehicles that do not report SoC reliably.</p><p>Site power is a shared resource. Implement phased demand limits and feeder-aware rules to prevent nuisance trips and costly peak charges. This is where charger-agnostic coordination pays off. If your team is designing depot policies or campus strategies, consult this playbook of <a href="https://michaelwoods53.github.io/PulseGeek/articles/ev-charging-load-management-strategies-for-depots-fleets-and-buildings">actionable strategies for managing EV charging load across depots, fleets, and buildings with grid-aware controls</a>. Combine these strategies with rule-based overrides for weather, outages, or special events. Keep operations simple for drivers and technicians, even if the backend is sophisticated.</p><p>Fleet operators increasingly participate in markets through aggregators. The most successful ones start with steady, low-risk value streams like demand charge management and programmatic peak events before attempting fast ancillary services. Revenue realism matters. Stack predictable savings and payments first, then experiment. For a structured view of the business side, study <a href="https://michaelwoods53.github.io/PulseGeek/articles/v2g-aggregator-business-models-revenue-stacks-and-regulatory-paths">key V2G aggregator business models with revenue stacking, value streams, and regulatory considerations</a>. Align operations with contracts to avoid penalties and maintain vehicle availability.</p><p>Finally, operationalize learning. Create weekly review loops that compare planned versus actual energy, missed events, and charger reliability. Track firmware versions as first-class configuration. Tie error codes to MTTR metrics and warranty discussions. These rhythms convert the theoretical interoperability of standards into durable performance.</p><h2 id="testing-and-certification" data-topic="diagnostics" data-summary="Testing, certification, and lab-to-field validation patterns.">Testing and certification: from lab conformance to field reliability</h2><p>Conformance without field validation is a trap. Begin with standards-aligned certification where possible, then design integration tests that mimic your topology. A reliable test sequence includes vehicle charger interactions over ISO 15118, charger to CSMS flows via OCPP, and grid events through IEEE 2030.5 or your chosen utility interface. Capture packet traces and application logs, and insist on reproducible test harnesses. Cross-vendor plugfests like those organized by CharIN provide valuable early signals, but your environment will surface unique timing and network conditions that deserve attention.</p><p>Build a small reference site. It should include at least two charger vendors, two vehicle platforms, and a site controller that speaks your chosen grid protocol. Validate firmware update paths, certificate rotations, and fault recoveries. Practice disaster scenarios: network partitions, certificate expiry, and grid trip events. Measure recovery time and define acceptable thresholds. Document every behavior nuance and turn them into acceptance criteria for future procurements.</p><p>Make certification a living process. Track changes in ISO 15118-20 features, OCPP 2.0.1 security profiles, and evolving grid program requirements. Establish a quarterly cadence to retest critical paths after updates. Keep a compatibility matrix that your support and operations teams can consult during troubleshooting. As your portfolio grows, consider a private conformance lab or a partnership with a university power lab to accelerate vendor onboarding.</p><p>To connect testing with engineering insight, add visual aids in your runbooks. The following diagrammatic photograph brief can help teams align on what the system looks like when all layers are considered.</p><figure><img src="https://michaelwoods53.github.io/PulseGeek/articles/vehicle-to-grid-integration-standards-overview-ocpp-iso-15118-ieee-2030-5-and-grid-codes/vehicle-to-grid-integration-standards-overview-ocpp-iso-15118-ieee-2030-5-and-grid-codes-lab-test-bench.webp" alt="EVSE lab bench with protocol analyzers and test vehicles" data-caption="Multi-vendor V2G conformance bench"><figcaption>A long lab bench with two DC fast chargers side by side, their panels open, revealing control boards and power modules.

Use a site controller or energy management system as the orchestration hub. It should translate grid or market signals into site targets, enforce feeder limits, and coordinate chargers through OCPP. Vehicles engage through ISO 15118 where available, but your logic should degrade gracefully to non-15118 vehicles with card-based identification and estimated SoC. For utility integration, adopt IEEE 2030.5 when required and abstract it behind your EMS so charger vendors remain interchangeable.</p><p>Data flow is as important as control flow. Stream meter values, session events, and health telemetry into a time-series store. Normalize identifiers across systems so you can correlate a vehicle, connector, charger, and utility event. Define retention and privacy policies early, particularly if you are handling driver identifiers or VINs through Plug and Charge. Anonymize where possible and apply role-based access controls that align with operational duties.</p><p>Urban utilities and cities can draw on lessons from Barcelona’s smart city programs, which emphasize open interfaces and vendor-neutral procurement to maintain long-term flexibility. Likewise, Singapore’s approach to codifying cybersecurity practices in tandem with digital services offers a blueprint for pairing innovation with risk management. These real examples show that public-sector governance can accelerate private-sector adoption when standards are part of procurement language and performance metrics.</p><p>If you are stitching V2G into a broader smart grid, revisit the architectural baseline in the <a href="https://michaelwoods53.github.io/PulseGeek/articles/smart-grid-integration-architectures-der-ami-v2g-and-interoperability-for-urban-utilities">interoperability and scalable architecture guide for urban utilities</a>. Use it to ensure that AMI, DERMS, and V2G share consistent identity, telemetry models, and security patterns. This alignment reduces integration cost and makes cross-program analytics possible.</p><figure><img src="https://michaelwoods53.github.io/PulseGeek/articles/vehicle-to-grid-integration-standards-overview-ocpp-iso-15118-ieee-2030-5-and-grid-codes/vehicle-to-grid-integration-standards-overview-ocpp-iso-15118-ieee-2030-5-and-grid-codes-architecture-whiteboard.webp" alt="Whiteboard sketch of V2G architecture across EV, EVSE, EMS, and utility" data-caption="Layered V2G architecture sketch"><figcaption>A large whiteboard with neatly drawn boxes labeled EV, EVSE, CSMS, EMS, and Utility, connected by colored arrows.

First, overloading a single protocol. Teams ask OCPP to deliver utility-grade dispatch or expect ISO 15118 to solve fleet optimization, then discover timing and feature gaps mid-deployment. Second, certificate lifecycle neglect. Projects launch with working Plug and Charge, but renewal and revocation paths are untested. Third, metering ambiguity. Without a clarified source of settlement truth and timestamp alignment, revenue disputes and program penalties follow.</p><p>Mitigations are pragmatic. Assign each standard a clear domain. Create a certificate runbook that includes inventory, issuers, renewal automations, and break-glass procedures. Establish meter hierarchies and time sync using NTP with monitoring. Where export is involved, add check meters and reconcile readings regularly. For operational resilience, maintain spare parts for high-wear items like contactors and cooling fans, and schedule preventive maintenance based on telemetry rather than calendar alone.</p><p>Adopt a gradual value ramp. Start with site peak shaving and vehicle readiness guarantees. Add participation in utility events once telemetry and verification are stable. Consider fast services only when your chargers, vehicles, and communications demonstrate consistent low-latency behavior. When in doubt about physical constraints and converter behavior, revisit this primer on <a href="https://michaelwoods53.github.io/PulseGeek/articles/how-does-bidirectional-charging-work-power-flow-converters-and-use-cases">power flow, converters, and real-world use cases</a> to ensure expectations match equipment limits.</p><p>Finally, make learning portable. Document incident retrospectives with packet captures and root causes linked to standards behavior. Share these with vendors and incorporate fixes into acceptance tests. Over time, this turns your organization into a reference customer with leverage to influence roadmaps and improve the broader ecosystem.</p><h2 id="next-steps" data-topic="next-steps" data-summary="Practical path to launch and scale standards-based V2G.">Where to go from here: a practical path to launch and scale</h2><p>Start with a clear architecture that respects the boundaries of OCPP, ISO 15118, and IEEE 2030.5. Choose vendors that can demonstrate end-to-end flows and survive fault injections. Align interconnection early, especially if export is on the roadmap. If you need a utility-centric perspective to refine those steps, the planning walkthrough on <a href="https://michaelwoods53.github.io/PulseGeek/articles/how-to-plan-v2g-interconnection-for-utilities-protection-metering-and-tariffs">utility protection, metering, tariffs, and standards</a> organizes the approval journey and shortens review cycles.</p><p>Build a pilot that matters, not a science project. Pick one site and one near-term value stream, then measure relentlessly. Combine the site’s operational strategy with the depot-focused guidance in <a href="https://michaelwoods53.github.io/PulseGeek/articles/ev-charging-load-management-strategies-for-depots-fleets-and-buildings">grid-aware EV charging load management across depots, fleets, and buildings</a>. Keep a watchlist of features to adopt later, such as ISO 15118-20 bidirectional DC or OCPP 2.0.1 device model extensions, and avoid blocking launch on them.</p><p>As markets evolve, update contracts to reflect new flexibility services and telemetry obligations. The overview of <a href="https://michaelwoods53.github.io/PulseGeek/articles/v2g-aggregator-business-models-revenue-stacks-and-regulatory-paths">V2G revenue stacking and regulatory paths</a> can help quantify upside without overpromising. When you are ready to extend into the broader grid modernization agenda, revisit the <a href="https://michaelwoods53.github.io/PulseGeek/articles/smart-grid-integration-architectures-der-ami-v2g-and-interoperability-for-urban-utilities">smart grid integration playbook for interoperable urban utility architectures</a> to ensure your V2G strategy aligns with AMI, DERMS, and substation automation roadmaps.</p><p>Standards are not an end in themselves. They are the grammar that lets vehicles, chargers, and grids hold meaningful conversations. Master the syntax, then focus on the story you want your portfolio to tell: reliable readiness for riders and drivers, measurable grid value, and a path that keeps options open as technology and policy move forward.</p></article></main><footer class="container" itemscope itemtype="https://schema.org/Organization"><hr /><!-- — Site-wide nav links (SEO-friendly) — --><nav aria-label="Footer navigation" itemscope itemtype="https://schema.org/SiteNavigationElement"><ul style="list-style:none; padding-left:0; margin:0; display:flex; flex-wrap:wrap; gap:.65rem;"><li itemprop="name"><a href="https://michaelwoods53.github.io/PulseGeek/about/" itemprop="url">About</a></li><li itemprop="name"><a href="https://michaelwoods53.github.io/PulseGeek/contact/" itemprop="url">Contact</a></li><li itemprop="name"><a href="https://michaelwoods53.github.io/PulseGeek/privacy/" itemprop="url">Privacy&nbsp;Policy</a></li><li itemprop="name"><a href="https://michaelwoods53.github.io/PulseGeek/terms/" itemprop="url">Terms&nbsp;of&nbsp;Service</a></li><li itemprop="name"><a href="https://michaelwoods53.github.io/PulseGeek/site-map/" itemprop="url">HTML&nbsp;Sitemap</a></li><li itemprop="name"><a href="https://michaelwoods53.github.io/PulseGeek/rss.xml" itemprop="url" title="RSS 2.0 feed">RSS&nbsp;Feed</a></li><li itemprop="name"><a href="https://michaelwoods53.github.io/PulseGeek/atom.xml" itemprop="url" title="Atom 1.0 feed">Atom</a></li><li itemprop="name"><a href="https://michaelwoods53.github.io/PulseGeek/feed.json" itemprop="url" title="JSON Feed 1.1">JSON&nbsp;Feed</a></li></ul></nav><!-- — Copyright — --><small style="display:block; margin-top:.75rem;"> © 2025 <span itemprop="name">PulseGeek</span>.
