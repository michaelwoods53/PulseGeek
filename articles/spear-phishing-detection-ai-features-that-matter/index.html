thinking, such as understanding language, recognizing patterns, and making decisions." tabindex="0">AI</a> features capture targeted social engineering patterns rather than generic spam cues. This list focuses on features that encode intent and personalization, since attackers study roles and leverage context. Each item includes a claim, a concrete example, and a tradeoff to help you choose what to implement first. The features span sender identity, content semantics, URL risk, headers, timing, and behavior. Together they give models layered evidence, allowing weak hints to reinforce each other. Use them to guide data collection and evaluation, not only feature engineering. When selecting features, prefer signals that remain stable under attacker adaptation and measureable across environments, and note where privacy or reliability limits apply to AI features used for phishing analysis.</p><section class="pg-summary-block pg-key-takeaways" role="note" aria-label="Key takeaways"><h2>Key takeaways</h2><ul><li>Combine sender, content, URL, header, and timing features for detection.</li><li>Favor features measurable across tenants to reduce brittle overfitting.</li><li>Score alignment signals jointly to surface targeted impersonation attempts.</li><li>Track tradeoffs such as privacy limits and spoof-resistant evasion.</li><li>Validate with temporal splits and role-focused error audits.</li></ul></section><section class="pg-listicle-item"><h2 id="1-display-name-impersonation-and-sender-anomalies" data-topic="sender identity" data-summary="Spot mismatched identities and impersonation patterns">1) Display name impersonation and sender anomalies</h2><p>Display name impersonation is a high-yield spear phishing indicator when combined with sender anomalies. The core idea is to compare the visible display name to the authenticated domain and directory entities, then score mismatches. For example, a message where the display reads “CFO Emma Li” but the DKIM-aligned domain is a consumer mail host suggests impersonation, especially if “Emma Li” exists in the directory and is high risk. A simple heuristic is to flag Levenshtein-close names to executives paired with unaffiliated domains and new sender age. The tradeoff is false positives on legitimate personal accounts or vendors using different domains. Mitigate by requiring multiple signals, such as alignment failures or recent first-contact, and by whitelisting known personal addresses for executives when policy allows.</p><figure class="code-example" data-language="python" data-caption="Minimal Python feature extraction for display-name and sender alignment" data-filename="features_displayname.py"><pre tabindex="0"><code class="language-python">

Model whether the message contains an In-Reply-To or References header that actually exists in your thread store, and whether the quoted text matches past correspondence hashes. For instance, a message with a realistic subject prefix and forged quoted block but no matching Message-ID suggests a spoofed continuation. Combine this with first-contact age to the recipient and domain reputation. A benefit is high precision on executive targets who see real ongoing threads. The tradeoff is storage and privacy constraints, since comparing quoted text requires retaining normalized thread fingerprints. Control exposure by hashing stable chunks and expiring old thread indices, and consider only lightweight alignment features for regulated environments.</p><div class="pg-section-summary" data-for="#2-reply-chain-hijacking-and-threading-gaps" role="note" aria-label="Section summary"><h3 class="summary-title">Section highlights</h3><ul class="mini"><li>Validate reply headers and quoted text against real thread anchors.</li><li>Use hashed fingerprints to balance detection utility with privacy.</li></ul></div></section><section class="pg-listicle-item"><h2 id="3-targeted-entity-and-role-cues" data-topic="targeted cues" data-summary="Find role-sensitive mentions and requests">3) Targeted entity and role cues</h2><p>Spear phishing often references specific entities and role-sensitive tasks, so features that detect targeted cues add strong signal. Extract mentions of internal systems, subsidiaries, or project code names paired with verbs like approve, wire, or release. Example: an email to accounts payable that references a real vendor and requests an urgent invoice update suggests directed intent. Complement NER with directory context, such as whether the recipient owns a finance role, and score role-action coherence. The tradeoff is leakage of sensitive vocabulary into the model if not handled carefully. Prefer hashing or category labels for proprietary terms, and avoid memorizing names by using subword tokenization plus role tags. Consider linking readers to an overview on <a class="glossary-term" href="https://pulsegeek.com/glossary/natural-language-processing/" data-tooltip="Natural language processing enables computers to understand, generate, and analyze human language, supporting chatbots, search, summarization, and document processing in business workflows." tabindex="0">NLP</a> for security tasks through this guide on tokenization and transformers applied to email risk <a href="https://pulsegeek.com/articles/nlp-essentials-for-security-language-meets-signals">NLP for security tasks</a>.</p><div class="pg-section-summary" data-for="#3-targeted-entity-and-role-cues" role="note" aria-label="Section summary"><h3 class="summary-title">Section highlights</h3><ul class="mini"><li>Extract entity mentions and role-action coherence for targeted intent.</li><li>Protect sensitive terms using hashing, categories, and subword methods.</li></ul></div></section><section class="pg-listicle-item"><h2 id="4-urgency-and-authority-language-patterns" data-topic="language patterns" data-summary="Score urgency and authority phrasing with context">4) Urgency and authority language patterns</h2><p>Urgency and authority phrasing remains a consistent spear phishing cue when scored with context. Build features for modal verbs and imperatives near time constraints and sanctions, such as must, immediately, before audit, or confidential. For example, a message addressed to payroll that reads please process this bonus before end of day and do not share outside HR combines urgency and authority. Calibrate by recipient role and past tone to reduce false alarms on real high-priority notices. The tradeoff is attacker adaptation through softer tone or translated language. Mitigate with proximity features that capture request structure rather than just specific words, and layer signals with sender anomalies.

Extract effective top-level domain and registerable domain, compute edit distance to known brands, and trace safe redirects to the final landing type. An example is a message that links to accounts-paypal-security[.]com with a redirect chain ending at a credential page. Combine URL age, hosting AS reputation, and query parameters matching login fields to raise risk. The tradeoff is operational cost and potential timeouts during resolution, which can delay delivery decisions. Use a staged approach that first scores lexical features, then fetches high-risk candidates asynchronously. For an end-to-end treatment that spans content, URLs, and attachments with evaluation metrics, see this guide on <a href="https://pulsegeek.com/articles/phishing-defense-with-nlp-a-complete-build-guide">NLP-powered phishing detection spanning content and URLs</a>.</p><div class="pg-section-summary" data-for="#5-url-risk-and-redirect-behavior" role="note" aria-label="Section summary"><h3 class="summary-title">Section highlights</h3><ul class="mini"><li>Score lexical similarity, age, and redirects to classify risky URLs.</li><li>Stage deep fetches after lightweight scoring to manage latency.</li></ul></div></section><section class="pg-listicle-item"><h2 id="6-attachment-risk-and-mime-signals" data-topic="attachments" data-summary="Evaluate attachment type and metadata hints">6) Attachment risk and MIME signals</h2><p>Attachment-focused features detect weaponized documents that accompany spear phishing. Score MIME type versus file signature, macro presence hints, and embedded link density. For example, an invoice.docm that declares application/msword but contains suspicious AutoOpen macros and external references is a strong risk. Cross-check attachment count and naming patterns like payment_update or wire_form against the request in the body to evaluate coherence. The tradeoff is heavy sandbox costs and evasion through format shifts. Control compute by using static triage first and sending only medium-high risk artifacts to dynamic analysis.

Score messages sent just before local close of business, on weekends for the recipient’s region, or during holidays when approvals are rushed. Geovelocity features compare recent authenticated logins for the sender domain to the message’s originating IP region, highlighting impossible travel. For example, a payment request lands at 7:56 pm Friday with an originating subnet in a region not seen for that partner in the last 90 days. These cues raise risk, especially for finance roles. The tradeoff is partial data, NAT artifacts, and legitimate off-hours work. Use rolling baselines instead of fixed rules and incorporate uncertainty, so anomalies inform risk without blocking genuine urgent tasks. Consider complementing this with a broader overview of AI in cybersecurity models and detection pipelines <a href="https://pulsegeek.com/articles/ai-in-cybersecurity-models-pipelines-and-defense">AI in cybersecurity models and detection pipelines</a>.</p><div class="pg-section-summary" data-for="#7-timing-and-geo-anomalies" role="note" aria-label="Section summary"><h3 class="summary-title">Section highlights</h3><ul class="mini"><li>Score off-hours sends and unusual origin regions against rolling baselines.</li><li>Model uncertainty to avoid blocking legitimate urgent after-hours tasks.</li></ul></div></section><section class="pg-listicle-item"><h2 id="8-header-alignment-and-auth-results" data-topic="header auth" data-summary="Use SPF, DKIM, DMARC with alignment">8) Header alignment and auth results</h2><p>Authentication results are foundational but need alignment-aware scoring to matter for spear phishing. Features should separately capture pass or fail for SPF, DKIM, and DMARC, and whether the aligned domain matches the visible From domain and the link domains. For example, a message with DKIM pass from a newsletter service but a From domain that differs from the brand in the body increases confusion risk. Conversely, a full alignment pass is not immunity, since compromised senders can abuse valid signatures. The tradeoff is overreliance on binary pass or fail that attackers can route around. Build graded penalties for failures and mismatches, and combine with display name checks and URL risk for higher precision. This pairs well with best practices for developing phishing classifiers <a href="https://pulsegeek.com/articles/developing-phishing-classifiers-with-ai-best-practices">best practices for developing phishing classifiers</a>.</p><div class="pg-section-summary" data-for="#8-header-alignment-and-auth-results" role="note" aria-label="Section summary"><h3 class="summary-title">Section highlights</h3><ul class="mini"><li>Score SPF, DKIM, DMARC plus alignment to From and link domains.</li><li>Avoid binary thinking and blend penalties with corroborating features.</li></ul></div></section><section class="pg-listicle-item"><h2 id="9-personalized-lure-similarity" data-topic="stylometry" data-summary="Compare lures to prior correspondence">9) Personalized lure similarity</h2><p>Similarity to prior correspondence can expose impersonation that mirrors a target’s style. Compute character n-gram or sentence embedding distances between an incoming message and a known sender’s historical style, focusing on signatures, salutations, and templated closings. For example, an email signed “Best regards, E. Santos” but sent from a new domain with subtle phrase shifts deviates from E. Santos’s usual cadence. The benefit is precision on high-value relationships, such as executive assistants and specific vendors. The tradeoff is risk of privacy exposure and the need for careful sampling to avoid overfitting to topics. Mitigate by storing only anonymized stylometric fingerprints and using temporal caps, and treat similarity as a soft weight that requires corroboration from identity or URL features.</p><div class="pg-section-summary" data-for="#9-personalized-lure-similarity" role="note" aria-label="Section summary"><h3 class="summary-title">Section highlights</h3><ul class="mini"><li>Compare stylometric fingerprints and closings against historical senders.</li><li>Use anonymized profiles and soft weights to limit privacy impact.</li></ul></div></section><section class="pg-listicle-item"><h2 id="10-post-delivery-behavioral-signals" data-topic="behavior signals" data-summary="Leverage safe telemetry after delivery">10) Post-delivery behavioral signals</h2><p>Behavioral telemetry after delivery can confirm risky intent and adapt future scoring. Features include rapid multi-recipient clicks to the same landing page, attempts to submit credentials, or near-instant deletion after preview. For instance, a link clicked within five seconds by several recipients across teams followed by browser interstitial blocks provides a strong adverse signal. Use this feedback to retrain models and adjust URL reputation. The tradeoff is privacy constraints and mixed visibility across tenants and devices. Collect only aggregate counts and time-to-event distributions when policy allows, and never store sensitive form content. Behavioral features should update reputations and assist triage rather than drive initial quarantine, unless corroborated by pre-delivery risk such as alignment failures.</p><div class="pg-section-summary" data-for="#10-post-delivery-behavioral-signals" role="note" aria-label="Section summary"><h3 class="summary-title">Section highlights</h3><ul class="mini"><li>Aggregate click and block telemetry to refine future risk scores.</li><li>Respect privacy and avoid storing sensitive post-click content.</li></ul></div></section><section class="pg-listicle-item"><h2 id="11-looking-ahead-to-feature-fusion" data-topic="fusion" data-summary="Combine features with calibrated models">11) Looking ahead to feature fusion</h2><p>The strongest gains come from fusing features with calibrated models rather than chasing a single silver bullet. Use stacking or attentive architectures that allow sender, content, URL, header, and timing features to interact, then calibrate outputs with Platt scaling or isotonic regression. For example, training a gradient-boosted tree on engineered signals and ensembling it with a lightweight transformer on body text tends to outperform either alone. The tradeoff is complexity and need for robust evaluation with temporal and entity-based splits. To prevent leakage, separate time windows and ensure targets do not appear in both train and test.
