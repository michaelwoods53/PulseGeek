Reentrancy and state desynchronization</h2><p>Reentrancy occurs when an external call lets a callee reenter your function before state is finalized. The result is a stale read that can bypass invariants, especially in withdrawal flows. A dependable rule of thumb is checks then effects then interactions, which front loads validation and state changes before any external interaction. Imagine a vault that updates balances after sending ETH. If the recipient reenters and calls withdraw again, they observe the old balance. Placing the state update first prevents that loop. The tradeoff is rigidity when composing across protocols that need callbacks. In those cases, guard the specific functions with a non-reentrant modifier and design narrowly scoped callbacks that cannot perform sensitive actions.</p><p>A second failure mode mirrors reentrancy without a loop. Cross function state desynchronization happens when function A updates internal accounting while function B assumes a different ordering of operations. Attackers chain calls to race between those expectations and withdraw more than allowed. A safe pattern is to centralize balance mutations behind one internal function that enforces invariant checks, then expose thin public wrappers. Prefer pull payments that let users withdraw instead of pushing funds during state changes. Pull patterns cut the surface of arbitrary recipient logic. The downside is UX friction for users who now perform two steps, yet the reduced attack surface is often worth the extra click.</p><p>When external calls are unavoidable, snapshot any critical values to memory and ensure they cannot be recomputed from mutable storage during the same transaction. For example, store a user’s withdrawable amount in a local variable after validation, subtract it from storage, then emit an event after the transfer. Avoid reading the same storage slot again after an external interaction. This emphasizes that correctness depends on ordering, not just the presence of a mutex. Finally, document assumptions at the function level. Clear notes about expected callbacks or absence thereof help auditors reason about reentrancy risks and guide future changes so they do not quietly break ordering guarantees.</p><figure class="code-example" data-language="solidity" data-caption="Checks effects interactions with ReentrancyGuard for a withdraw flow" data-filename="Vault.sol"><pre tabindex="0"><code class="language-solidity">

Integer math traps and unsafe assumptions</h2><p>Arithmetic overflow and underflow are less visible since <a class="glossary-term" href="https://pulsegeek.com/glossary/solidity/" data-tooltip="Solidity is a programming language for writing smart contracts, mainly on EVM-compatible blockchains. It looks like JavaScript and adds features for blockchain data, events, and access control." tabindex="0">Solidity</a> 0.8 added built-in checks, yet logic errors remain. The claim to test is not only whether math reverts but whether the rounding and unit conversions match business rules. Consider reward calculations that multiply a rate by a balance, then divide by a precision factor. Integer division truncates toward zero, which can leak or accrue dust when repeated many times. A rule of thumb is to scale operands first to preserve precision, then divide once at the end. The tradeoff is potential overflow, so use checked math on scaled values or restructure the formula to bound intermediate terms within safe ranges.</p><p>Unit mismatches silently produce skewed outputs. Tokens can use different decimals, or an oracle may report prices with unique scaling. Mixing a 6-decimal asset with an 18-decimal quote creates large distortions. Enforce explicit unit annotations next to variables and normalize inputs as the first step in functions that combine data sources. For instance, convert all amounts to 18-decimal fixed point within internal logic, then convert back at the boundaries. The cost is a bit more gas and code verbosity, but it makes audits straightforward. Auditors can trace unit flows line by line, which reduces the chance that a hidden rounding artifact undermines accounting over thousands of transactions.</p><p>Time-based math introduces another edge case. Using block timestamps to pro-rate rewards or vesting can slip when miners skew timestamps slightly within consensus tolerances. Avoid equality checks against timestamps and prefer greater-than comparisons with clear buffers. When computing rates over time, store the last updated timestamp and accumulate deltas so that small skews average out across periods. If precise calendar behavior is needed, off-chain orchestration might be safer than complex on-chain schedules. The principle is to accept the granularity of the platform and reflect that in your formulas. Treat time as approximate and design tolerances accordingly so minor variance does not unlock unintended payouts.</p><div class="pg-section-summary" data-for="#2-integer-math-traps-and-unsafe-assumptions" role="note" aria-label="Section summary"><h3 class="summary-title">Section highlights</h3><ul class="mini"><li>Normalize units and delay division to reduce rounding loss.</li><li>Treat time as approximate and buffer sensitive comparisons.</li></ul></div><h2 id="3-access-control-and-privilege-drift" data-topic="Auth" data-summary="Lock down who can do what and when.">3. Access control and privilege drift</h2><p>Most high impact incidents start with unclear authority. The core claim is that explicit roles, ownership transfer procedures, and pause mechanisms prevent small mistakes from becoming systemic failures. Use a simple role matrix to define who can upgrade, mint, pause, or withdraw. Then enforce it with a well tested access control library and emit events on sensitive actions for clear audits. As a practice, require multi-signature approvals for administrative operations and document timelocks on upgrades so observers can react. The tradeoff is operational overhead, but it converts single points of failure into shared accountability and gives users time to exit if a configuration looks risky.</p><p>Initializer misuse is a recurring problem in <a class="glossary-term" href="https://pulsegeek.com/glossary/upgradeable-proxy/" data-tooltip="An upgradeable proxy lets a contract’s logic be replaced while keeping the same address and state, enabling fixes and improvements after deployment." tabindex="0">upgradeable contracts</a>. If an implementation contract exposes an unprotected initialize function, anyone can call it and set themselves as owner. The safe habit is to disable initializers on the logic contract and run initialization only through the proxy during deployment. Additionally, favor constructor-like patterns that cannot be invoked twice. When migrations require re-initialization, increment versioned initializers and gate each step. The why is simple. Upgrades spread authority across more components, so every path that sets storage must be protected. Versioning clarifies intent and reduces the chance that a forgotten initializer becomes a stealthy control grab.</p><p>Role sprawl sneaks in as products evolve. A temporary role added to fix an incident may linger longer than planned, increasing the blast radius of a compromised key. Create expiration for emergency permissions and schedule automatic downgrades once a fix is verified in production. Logs should show when roles are granted and revoked so automated monitors can alert on unexpected changes. Finally, establish a routine for rotating keys and use hardware backed signers for privileged accounts. The limitation is human process discipline, which is never perfect. Automate as much as possible through policy-enforcing contracts and leave the smallest possible set of permissions active at rest.</p><div class="pg-section-summary" data-for="#3-access-control-and-privilege-drift" role="note" aria-label="Section summary"><h3 class="summary-title">Section highlights</h3><ul class="mini"><li>Define roles, add multisig and timelocks, and log sensitive actions.</li><li>Expire emergency permissions and automate routine key rotations.</li></ul></div><h2 id="4-oracle-and-liquidity-manipulation" data-topic="Oracles" data-summary="Price integrity depends on market depth and sampling windows.">4. Oracle and liquidity manipulation</h2><p>When a contract relies on a price feed, the integrity of that feed becomes the system’s integrity. Thin liquidity and short sampling windows make prices easy to move with flash loans or coordinated trades. The claim is that a robust oracle reads from markets that an attacker cannot cheaply dominate for a single block. A rule of thumb is to use time-weighted averages over windows that exceed the time needed to unwind an attack. This reduces sensitivity to spikes. The tradeoff is latency. Longer windows respond slowly to real market moves. Choose windows based on expected volatility and the economic value protected by the price.</p><p>Composability creates hidden coupling. A lending protocol that uses a spot price from an AMM may think it is diversified, but if a large share of liquidity is owned by the borrower, they can swing the price and drain collateral. Defend by reading from multiple sources and rejecting updates that deviate beyond a sanity threshold. If only one venue exists, add rate limiters that bound per-block price changes and pause risky actions on extreme moves. Instrument metrics that report the cost to manipulate the oracle given current depth so the team can adjust parameters as markets evolve. This turns a vague threat into a quantifiable control.</p><p>Implementation details matter. If your oracle uses on-chain observations, ensure it cannot be updated through a low liquidity pool that shares a token but does not represent the dominant market. Validate token pairing and minimum reserves before accepting a reading. If using an external oracle, authenticate data with signatures and sequence numbers to prevent replay or stale updates. Finally, document dependencies and upgrade processes for oracle contracts. Changes to feeds should pass through review similar to any privileged operation. The why is straightforward. Price dependency is a critical path, and small misconfigurations ripple outward until they touch user balances and liquidation logic.</p><div class="pg-section-summary" data-for="#4-oracle-and-liquidity-manipulation" role="note" aria-label="Section summary"><h3 class="summary-title">Section highlights</h3><ul class="mini"><li>Favor time weighted prices and bound per block changes.</li><li>Diversify feeds and validate liquidity depth before trusting quotes.</li></ul></div><p>Want to practice reading flows and validating assumptions on-chain with a friendly interface?
