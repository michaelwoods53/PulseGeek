bidirectional power. </figcaption></figure></header><p>Utilities ready to unlock bidirectional value often ask a simple question with complex edges: how to plan V2G interconnection for utilities with protection, metering, and tariffs aligned. The path works best as a sequence of clear decisions and gated tests that build confidence. Below, we move step by step from standards mapping to settlement design, with field notes drawn from active pilots.</p><h2 id="map-interconnection-and-standards" data-topic="setup-guide" data-summary="Define V2G interconnection types and standards alignment.">Map interconnection pathways and align the standards</h2><p>Start by deciding where V2G will touch your system. Depots, workplace fleets, and multi-dwelling carparks create different duty cycles and fault exposures, so interconnection class and study depth should match site risk and capacity. Many utilities now apply fast-track screens adapted from DER interconnections to right-size the review for Level 2 bidirectional chargers and small DC systems. California’s VGI pilots and UK fleet trials with Nissan and Octopus Energy show the value of a predictable intake form that captures feeder headroom, charger make and model, and communications stack up front.</p><p>Next, anchor your communications choices. Charger-to-CSMS often rides on OCPP, while EV-to-charger and energy services can lean on ISO 15118-20 for bidirectional negotiation. For northbound utility interfaces, IEEE 2030.5 and OpenADR are common in North America, with IEC 61850 and related profiles in Europe. A utility-facing explainer on OCPP, ISO 15118, IEEE 2030.5, UL and grid codes can help teams reconcile naming, certificate flows, and test harnesses. Aligning these early reduces retests when firmware updates arrive mid-project.</p><p>Then write an interop plan that includes lab validation and field soak. Specify firmware baselines, certificate provisioning, and fallback behavior if comms drop during export. Include cybersecurity controls such as mutual TLS and certificate revocation checks. Place your V2G roadmap within a broader modernization context by referencing a complete guide to interoperable DER, AMI and V2G architectures for urban utilities so AMI event windows, outage management, and DERMS dispatch play nicely with new bidirectional endpoints.</p><ol><li>Classify sites by feeder constraints, export size, and duty cycle.</li><li>Select charger, EV, and CSMS stacks with documented V2G capabilities.</li><li>Define northbound protocols and security, including certificate authorities.</li><li>Run bench tests for plug-and-charge, export commands, and safe fallback.</li><li>Create intake forms and screening rules tailored to bidirectional EVs.</li></ol><p>Troubleshooting tip: if ISO 15118 contract certificates fail during export authorization, verify clock synchronization across charger, CSMS, and certificate servers. Even small NTP drift can break mutual authentication under load.</p><h2 id="engineer-protection-and-grounding" data-topic="diagnostics" data-summary="Design protection, anti-islanding, and grounding for safe V2G.">Engineer protection, grounding, and islanding logic</h2><p>Protection for V2G begins with coordination. Treat each bidirectional charger as an inverter-based resource when exporting, and confirm anti-islanding per IEEE 1547 family and local grid codes. For AC V2G, ensure the charger’s embedded relays and grid-monitoring functions coordinate with upstream reclosers and feeder relays. In fleet depots, consider a site-level trip that cleanly removes all export in abnormal conditions without stranding vehicles that still need to charge. Burlington, Vermont’s municipal V2G work with school buses highlighted the value of site-level permissive signals tied to feeder status.</p><p>Grounding deserves equal attention. DC V2G can introduce touch-voltage considerations and ground-fault detection strategies that differ from standard Level 2 charging. Require certified equipment with UL listings appropriate to bidirectional operation and confirm fault clearing times in the protection study. Utility operators should also document how reverse power affects transformer thermal models and voltage regulation. On older networks, reverse power through on-load tap changers may stress equipment if export ramps are not bounded.</p><p>Create operating envelopes that your SCADA or DERMS can enforce. Define export windows, feeder voltage bands, and “no-go” conditions like maintenance switching. If you plan for vehicle-to-building resiliency, insist on transfer switches and clearly separated islanded buses to keep lineworker safety sacrosanct. During commissioning, stage tests that simulate undervoltage, overfrequency, and comms loss to verify a fail-safe halt to export with continued safe charging where possible.</p><ol><li>Run a protection study that models reverse power and inverter tripping curves.</li><li>Verify anti-islanding against local adoption of IEEE 1547 and grid codes.</li><li>Specify grounding and GFDI schemes for AC and DC bidirectional hardware.</li><li>Set DERMS rules for export limits, voltage bands, and ramp rates.</li><li>Commission with abnormal condition tests and document relay settings.</li></ol><figure><img src="file:///C:/sites/PulseGeek/articles/how-to-plan-v2g-interconnection-for-utilities-protection-metering-and-tariffs/how-to-plan-v2g-interconnection-for-utilities-protection-metering-and-tariffs-protection-scheme-diagram.webp" alt="One-line diagram showing V2G charger protection and relays"><figcaption>Protection one-line for a depot with bidirectional chargers.</figcaption></figure><p>Expert tip: require firmware that exposes trip cause codes through OCPP or a site gateway. When an export halt occurs, operations staff can triage whether it was protection, voltage limits, or communications, reducing truck rolls.</p><h2 id="meter-settle-and-tariff" data-topic="value-realization" data-summary="Deploy metering, settlement, and tariffs for V2G value.">Meter, settle, and design tariffs for bidirectional value</h2><p>Accurate settlement starts with metering topology. Many utilities use utility-grade meters at the service point to capture net export while relying on charger or site submeters to partition energy by vehicle or time window. AMI capabilities differ, so verify whether your meters register delivered and received energy separately, and how interval data flags direction. Recent school bus pilots in California and New York found that aligning clock intervals across AMI, chargers, and aggregators is essential to reconcile exports used for demand response.</p><p>Tariff structures should encourage controllable exports without rewarding coincident stress. Consider time-varying export credits that reflect feeder conditions, not just wholesale prices. Avoid punishing demand charges for brief V2G events by defining EV-only demand determinants or using ratchets tied to charging windows. Many fleets will still prioritize mobility, so include opt-out clauses and minimum state-of-charge bounds. For a practical walk-through of site-level tactics, see strategies for managing EV charging load across depots and buildings that integrate grid-aware controls and throttling.</p><p>Finally, standardize how data flows to billing and market interfaces. Aggregators or utility DERMS should provide signed interval files with direction, locational tags, and event identifiers for programs like demand response or frequency response. Where regulation permits, baseline methods used for stationary storage can adapt to mobile assets with adjustments for availability. Build a dispute-resolution playbook that covers AMI outages, charger firmware mismatches, and missed telemetry so settlements remain credible during scale-up.</p><ol><li>Select metering points and confirm import and export registers in AMI.</li><li>Define data schemas for charger, aggregator, and billing reconciliation.</li><li>Design export credits and demand determinants that reflect grid value.</li><li>Set mobility safeguards like minimum SOC and opt-out windows.</li><li>Pilot settlement with a shadow-bill period before going live.</li></ol><figure><img src="file:///C:/sites/PulseGeek/articles/how-to-plan-v2g-interconnection-for-utilities-protection-metering-and-tariffs/how-to-plan-v2g-interconnection-for-utilities-protection-metering-and-tariffs-metering-dashboard.webp" alt="Utility dashboard with bidirectional metering intervals and event tags"><figcaption>Interval data view for V2G settlement checks.</figcaption></figure><p>Field note: for fleets that park behind the meter under a commercial tariff, check how your interconnection agreement treats netting by interval versus monthly totals. Interval-level netting avoids obscuring short export windows that earn grid services value.</p><p>Before you move on, bookmark a systems-level resource that connects DERMS, AMI, and V2G into one operating model by exploring a complete guide to interoperable DER, AMI and V2G architectures for urban utilities. Pair that with internal standards literacy via a utility-facing explainer on OCPP, ISO 15118, IEEE 2030.5, UL and grid codes to keep procurement, operations, and vendors speaking the same language. With those foundations, your team can grow from pilot to portfolio without rewiring processes.</p><p>Looking ahead, plan for software-defined upgrades. As ISO 15118-20 features mature and grid orchestration evolves, keep a living test plan, refresh protection settings with feeder changes, and iterate tariffs as data teaches you where V2G helps most. That is how to plan V2G interconnection for utilities as an ongoing capability rather than a one-off project.</p><p><a href="file:///C:/sites/PulseGeek/articles/smart-grid-integration-architectures-der-ami-v2g-and-interoperability-for-urban-utilities/index.html">complete guide to interoperable DER, AMI and V2G architectures for urban utilities</a> | <a href="file:///C:/sites/PulseGeek/articles/vehicle-to-grid-integration-standards-overview-ocpp-iso-15118-ieee-2030-5-and-grid-codes/index.html">utility-facing explainer on OCPP, ISO 15118, IEEE 2030.5, UL and grid codes</a></p></article></main><footer class="container" itemscope itemtype="https://schema.org/Organization"><hr /><!-- — Site-wide nav links (SEO-friendly) — --><nav aria-label="Footer navigation" itemscope itemtype="https://schema.org/SiteNavigationElement"><ul style="list-style:none; padding-left:0; margin:0; display:flex; flex-wrap:wrap; gap:.65rem;"><li itemprop="name"><a href="file:///C:/sites/PulseGeek/about/index.html" itemprop="url">About</a></li><li itemprop="name"><a href="file:///C:/sites/PulseGeek/contact/index.html" itemprop="url">Contact</a></li><li itemprop="name"><a href="file:///C:/sites/PulseGeek/privacy/index.html" itemprop="url">Privacy&nbsp;Policy</a></li><li itemprop="name"><a href="file:///C:/sites/PulseGeek/terms/index.html" itemprop="url">Terms&nbsp;of&nbsp;Service</a></li><li itemprop="name"><a href="file:///C:/sites/PulseGeek/site-map/index.html" itemprop="url">HTML&nbsp;Sitemap</a></li><li itemprop="name"><a href="file:///C:/sites/PulseGeek/rss.xml" itemprop="url" title="RSS 2.0 feed">RSS&nbsp;Feed</a></li><li itemprop="name"><a href="file:///C:/sites/PulseGeek/atom.xml" itemprop="url" title="Atom 1.0 feed">Atom</a></li><li itemprop="name"><a href="file:///C:/sites/PulseGeek/feed.json" itemprop="url" title="JSON Feed 1.1">JSON&nbsp;Feed</a></li></ul></nav><!-- — Copyright — --><small style="display:block; margin-top:.75rem;"> © 2025 <span itemprop="name">PulseGeek</span>.
