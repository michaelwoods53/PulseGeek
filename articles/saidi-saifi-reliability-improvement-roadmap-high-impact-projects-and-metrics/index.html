The following high‑impact projects give you a practical sequence, with the metrics that keep each step honest and measurable.</p><p>Consider this your working list. Start where your constraints are loudest, then progress toward deeper OT and IT convergence as your telemetry, controls, and governance mature.</p><h2 id="1-foundation-accurate-events-and-customer-mapping" data-topic="data-quality" data-summary="Normalize events and strengthen feeder-to-customer mapping.">1) Lay the foundation: accurate events and feeder-to-customer mapping</h2><p>Begin with the plumbing that feeds every SAIDI and SAIFI chart: event integrity and customer connectivity. If your OMS, AMI, and SCADA disagree about who was out and for how long, downstream automation cannot prove its value. Prioritize an event normalization pipeline that de‑duplicates AMI last‑gasp and restoration pings, reconciles OMS tickets, and aligns SCADA alarms with switching timestamps. Then, refresh your connectivity model so each premise rolls up to the correct transformer and feeder segment, especially after load transfers and capital work. This step unlocks credible metrics by establishing a single source of truth for interruption counts and durations.</p><p>To govern the data lifecycle, adopt a utility‑specific schema and quality checks across ingestion, enrichment, and publishing. A <a href="https://michaelwoods53.github.io/PulseGeek/articles/data-governance-for-utility-ot-it-convergence-models-security-and-interoperability">governance blueprint for OT and IT convergence that covers models, quality, security, and interoperability</a> helps institutionalize naming standards, lineage, and access controls. When every outage event carries a consistent taxonomy for cause, device, weather context, and restoration action, reliability analysts can compare like with like and isolate the practices that actually move SAIDI and SAIFI.</p><p>Operationally, treat this as a backlog of small, measurable cleanups. Examples include resolving “orphan” meters with missing transformer links, enforcing time synchronization across head‑ends and substation clocks, and standardizing momentary versus sustained thresholds to match regulatory definitions. Track a short list of meta‑metrics: percentage of customers with verified phase and transformer, event duplication rate, and mean time to validate an outage batch. When these converge, your SAIDI/SAIFI reports stop drifting, and every subsequent automation or protection upgrade can be tied to reliable baselines.</p><h2 id="2-automation-flisr-and-der-aware-operations" data-topic="grid-automation" data-summary="Deploy FLISR, optimize switching, and integrate DER-aware protection.">2) Cut minutes and counts: FLISR, topology-aware switching, and DER-aware protection</h2><p>Once the data backbone is trustworthy, focus on grid‑edge automation that shortens restoration and narrows outage footprints. Fault Location Isolation and Service Restoration, or FLISR, uses sensors, reclosers, and sectionalizers to isolate faults and backfeed healthy sections automatically. Modern ADMS platforms extend this with topology‑aware switching, coordinating crews and devices for safe, fast reconfiguration. Use weather and vegetation risk layers to select feeders for early deployment and to set targeted SAIDI reductions for those circuits. The right pilot scope includes 3–5 feeders with diverse profiles, so you learn across urban, suburban, and rural conditions.</p><p>Visibility is the other half. Pair feeder automation with high‑resolution telemetry at the substation and along the line. Where feasible, micro‑PMUs can sharpen fault location and detect oscillations that precede protection trips. For a deeper view into how phasor data supports distribution operations, explore <a href="https://michaelwoods53.github.io/PulseGeek/articles/synchrophasor-pmu-data-for-distribution-visibility-use-cases-and-integration-patterns">PMU data that enhances distribution visibility and integration patterns</a>. Integrate OMS and ADMS so your switching actions update customer restoration estimates automatically, improving both CAIDI and customer satisfaction metrics in one move.</p><p>As distributed energy resources grow, protection and automation must be DER‑aware. Update relay settings, directionalize where needed, and validate reclosing logic against inverter ride‑through profiles. Align this work with interoperability milestones in a <a href="https://michaelwoods53.github.io/PulseGeek/articles/smart-grid-integration-architectures-der-ami-v2g-and-interoperability-for-urban-utilities">complete guide to smart grid integration across DER, AMI, V2G, and open standards</a>. For a field view, track device actuation success rate, automated isolation time, and the percentage of customers restored by switching rather than repair. These operational metrics translate directly into SAIDI and SAIFI changes by shrinking both the number affected and the minutes accrued.</p><ul><li>Tip: Validate automated switching paths with seasonal load forecasts before enabling closed‑loop FLISR.</li><li>Tip: Instrument critical laterals with low‑cost line sensors to reduce missed fault indications.</li><li>Tip: Record cause codes at the device level to distinguish vegetation, equipment, animals, and third‑party damage.</li></ul><figure><img src="https://michaelwoods53.github.io/PulseGeek/articles/saidi-saifi-reliability-improvement-roadmap-high-impact-projects-and-metrics/saidi-saifi-reliability-improvement-roadmap-high-impact-projects-and-metrics-feeder-automation-cabinet.webp" alt="Feeder automation cabinet with recloser controller and sensors" data-caption="Grid-edge automation ready for FLISR."><figcaption>Close three‑quarter view of an open green metal cabinet beside a distribution pole.

Substations that speak IEC 61850 and legacy serial protocols need layered defenses, starting with asset inventories, network segmentation, and strict access pathways. A zero‑trust stance for vendor laptops and field gateways, combined with centralized time‑stamped logging, helps root‑cause misoperations and contain incidents. Consider using a defense‑in‑depth approach mapped to device, network, and application layers, and schedule patch windows in step with relay testing and seasonal load changes, not as an afterthought.</p><p>Operational discipline is the reliability multiplier. Create runbooks that tie detection, decision, and action to named roles, with drills that rehearse feeder switching, DER curtailment, and customer messaging under degraded conditions. Practice “storm mode” transitions that escalate telemetry granularity, invoke pre‑approved switching plans, and stage crews by risk corridor. Many cities that invest in resilient operations, such as Singapore’s Smart Nation initiatives and Barcelona’s smart grid programs, demonstrate the value of coordinated playbooks that align data, devices, and people. Your SAIDI and SAIFI dashboards should reflect these drills with tagged scenarios to evaluate readiness.</p><p>Finally, link reliability to security audits and standards conformance. Use change‑management metrics like mean time to approve relay setting updates, percentage of substations with fully validated role‑based access, and coverage of network visibility at critical assets. Utilities can draw practical checklists from resources that outline layered controls in substations. For example, review a <a href="https://michaelwoods53.github.io/PulseGeek/articles/security-controls-for-iec-61850-substations-a-defense-in-depth-checklist">defense‑in‑depth checklist tailored to IEC 61850 environments</a> to structure assessments across lifecycles. Tie these audits to capital planning so cyber upgrades and reliability projects share work windows and create fewer field visits overall.</p><figure><img src="https://michaelwoods53.github.io/PulseGeek/articles/saidi-saifi-reliability-improvement-roadmap-high-impact-projects-and-metrics/saidi-saifi-reliability-improvement-roadmap-high-impact-projects-and-metrics-operations-runbook-workshop.webp" alt="Operations team reviewing reliability runbooks during a workshop" data-caption="Runbooks aligned to real switching decisions."><figcaption>Medium shot of a conference room table with printed runbooks, highlighters, and a laptop showing a one‑line diagram. Three utility engineers point to a section labeled Restoration Steps. The room has neutral walls, a glass board with sticky notes arranged by scenario, and soft daylight from a side window. Coffee cups and safety vests on chair backs hint at field‑ready practicality.</figcaption></figure><p>Bring the pieces together with a short, staged plan: fix the data, automate the edges, and drill the playbook. Use clear metrics that map to SAIDI and SAIFI, but also track the upstream indicators that make those numbers move. When each improvement is paired with a defined baseline and an operational owner, reliability gains become repeatable rather than accidental.</p></article></main><footer class="container" itemscope itemtype="https://schema.org/Organization"><hr /><!-- — Site-wide nav links (SEO-friendly) — --><nav aria-label="Footer navigation" itemscope itemtype="https://schema.org/SiteNavigationElement"><ul style="list-style:none; padding-left:0; margin:0; display:flex; flex-wrap:wrap; gap:.65rem;"><li itemprop="name"><a href="https://michaelwoods53.github.io/PulseGeek/about/" itemprop="url">About</a></li><li itemprop="name"><a href="https://michaelwoods53.github.io/PulseGeek/contact/" itemprop="url">Contact</a></li><li itemprop="name"><a href="https://michaelwoods53.github.io/PulseGeek/privacy/" itemprop="url">Privacy&nbsp;Policy</a></li><li itemprop="name"><a href="https://michaelwoods53.github.io/PulseGeek/terms/" itemprop="url">Terms&nbsp;of&nbsp;Service</a></li><li itemprop="name"><a href="https://michaelwoods53.github.io/PulseGeek/site-map/" itemprop="url">HTML&nbsp;Sitemap</a></li><li itemprop="name"><a href="https://michaelwoods53.github.io/PulseGeek/rss.xml" itemprop="url" title="RSS 2.0 feed">RSS&nbsp;Feed</a></li><li itemprop="name"><a href="https://michaelwoods53.github.io/PulseGeek/atom.xml" itemprop="url" title="Atom 1.0 feed">Atom</a></li><li itemprop="name"><a href="https://michaelwoods53.github.io/PulseGeek/feed.json" itemprop="url" title="JSON Feed 1.1">JSON&nbsp;Feed</a></li></ul></nav><!-- — Copyright — --><small style="display:block; margin-top:.75rem;"> © 2025 <span itemprop="name">PulseGeek</span>.

The following high‑impact projects give you a practical sequence, with the metrics that keep each step honest and measurable.</p><p>Consider this your working list. Start where your constraints are loudest, then progress toward deeper OT and IT convergence as your telemetry, controls, and governance mature.</p><h2 id="1-foundation-accurate-events-and-customer-mapping" data-topic="data-quality" data-summary="Normalize events and strengthen feeder-to-customer mapping.">1) Lay the foundation: accurate events and feeder-to-customer mapping</h2><p>Begin with the plumbing that feeds every SAIDI and SAIFI chart: event integrity and customer connectivity. If your OMS, AMI, and SCADA disagree about who was out and for how long, downstream automation cannot prove its value. Prioritize an event normalization pipeline that de‑duplicates AMI last‑gasp and restoration pings, reconciles OMS tickets, and aligns SCADA alarms with switching timestamps. Then, refresh your connectivity model so each premise rolls up to the correct transformer and feeder segment, especially after load transfers and capital work. This step unlocks credible metrics by establishing a single source of truth for interruption counts and durations.</p><p>To govern the data lifecycle, adopt a utility‑specific schema and quality checks across ingestion, enrichment, and publishing. A <a href="https://github.com/michaelwoods53/PulseGeek/articles/data-governance-for-utility-ot-it-convergence-models-security-and-interoperability">governance blueprint for OT and IT convergence that covers models, quality, security, and interoperability</a> helps institutionalize naming standards, lineage, and access controls. When every outage event carries a consistent taxonomy for cause, device, weather context, and restoration action, reliability analysts can compare like with like and isolate the practices that actually move SAIDI and SAIFI.</p><p>Operationally, treat this as a backlog of small, measurable cleanups. Examples include resolving “orphan” meters with missing transformer links, enforcing time synchronization across head‑ends and substation clocks, and standardizing momentary versus sustained thresholds to match regulatory definitions. Track a short list of meta‑metrics: percentage of customers with verified phase and transformer, event duplication rate, and mean time to validate an outage batch. When these converge, your SAIDI/SAIFI reports stop drifting, and every subsequent automation or protection upgrade can be tied to reliable baselines.</p><h2 id="2-automation-flisr-and-der-aware-operations" data-topic="grid-automation" data-summary="Deploy FLISR, optimize switching, and integrate DER-aware protection.">2) Cut minutes and counts: FLISR, topology-aware switching, and DER-aware protection</h2><p>Once the data backbone is trustworthy, focus on grid‑edge automation that shortens restoration and narrows outage footprints. Fault Location Isolation and Service Restoration, or FLISR, uses sensors, reclosers, and sectionalizers to isolate faults and backfeed healthy sections automatically. Modern ADMS platforms extend this with topology‑aware switching, coordinating crews and devices for safe, fast reconfiguration. Use weather and vegetation risk layers to select feeders for early deployment and to set targeted SAIDI reductions for those circuits. The right pilot scope includes 3–5 feeders with diverse profiles, so you learn across urban, suburban, and rural conditions.</p><p>Visibility is the other half. Pair feeder automation with high‑resolution telemetry at the substation and along the line. Where feasible, micro‑PMUs can sharpen fault location and detect oscillations that precede protection trips. For a deeper view into how phasor data supports distribution operations, explore <a href="https://github.com/michaelwoods53/PulseGeek/articles/synchrophasor-pmu-data-for-distribution-visibility-use-cases-and-integration-patterns">PMU data that enhances distribution visibility and integration patterns</a>. Integrate OMS and ADMS so your switching actions update customer restoration estimates automatically, improving both CAIDI and customer satisfaction metrics in one move.</p><p>As distributed energy resources grow, protection and automation must be DER‑aware. Update relay settings, directionalize where needed, and validate reclosing logic against inverter ride‑through profiles. Align this work with interoperability milestones in a <a href="https://github.com/michaelwoods53/PulseGeek/articles/smart-grid-integration-architectures-der-ami-v2g-and-interoperability-for-urban-utilities">complete guide to smart grid integration across DER, AMI, V2G, and open standards</a>. For a field view, track device actuation success rate, automated isolation time, and the percentage of customers restored by switching rather than repair. These operational metrics translate directly into SAIDI and SAIFI changes by shrinking both the number affected and the minutes accrued.</p><ul><li>Tip: Validate automated switching paths with seasonal load forecasts before enabling closed‑loop FLISR.</li><li>Tip: Instrument critical laterals with low‑cost line sensors to reduce missed fault indications.</li><li>Tip: Record cause codes at the device level to distinguish vegetation, equipment, animals, and third‑party damage.</li></ul><figure><img src="https://github.com/michaelwoods53/PulseGeek/articles/saidi-saifi-reliability-improvement-roadmap-high-impact-projects-and-metrics/saidi-saifi-reliability-improvement-roadmap-high-impact-projects-and-metrics-feeder-automation-cabinet.webp" alt="Feeder automation cabinet with recloser controller and sensors" data-caption="Grid-edge automation ready for FLISR."><figcaption>Close three‑quarter view of an open green metal cabinet beside a distribution pole.

Substations that speak IEC 61850 and legacy serial protocols need layered defenses, starting with asset inventories, network segmentation, and strict access pathways. A zero‑trust stance for vendor laptops and field gateways, combined with centralized time‑stamped logging, helps root‑cause misoperations and contain incidents. Consider using a defense‑in‑depth approach mapped to device, network, and application layers, and schedule patch windows in step with relay testing and seasonal load changes, not as an afterthought.</p><p>Operational discipline is the reliability multiplier. Create runbooks that tie detection, decision, and action to named roles, with drills that rehearse feeder switching, DER curtailment, and customer messaging under degraded conditions. Practice “storm mode” transitions that escalate telemetry granularity, invoke pre‑approved switching plans, and stage crews by risk corridor. Many cities that invest in resilient operations, such as Singapore’s Smart Nation initiatives and Barcelona’s smart grid programs, demonstrate the value of coordinated playbooks that align data, devices, and people. Your SAIDI and SAIFI dashboards should reflect these drills with tagged scenarios to evaluate readiness.</p><p>Finally, link reliability to security audits and standards conformance. Use change‑management metrics like mean time to approve relay setting updates, percentage of substations with fully validated role‑based access, and coverage of network visibility at critical assets. Utilities can draw practical checklists from resources that outline layered controls in substations. For example, review a <a href="https://github.com/michaelwoods53/PulseGeek/articles/security-controls-for-iec-61850-substations-a-defense-in-depth-checklist">defense‑in‑depth checklist tailored to IEC 61850 environments</a> to structure assessments across lifecycles. Tie these audits to capital planning so cyber upgrades and reliability projects share work windows and create fewer field visits overall.</p><figure><img src="https://github.com/michaelwoods53/PulseGeek/articles/saidi-saifi-reliability-improvement-roadmap-high-impact-projects-and-metrics/saidi-saifi-reliability-improvement-roadmap-high-impact-projects-and-metrics-operations-runbook-workshop.webp" alt="Operations team reviewing reliability runbooks during a workshop" data-caption="Runbooks aligned to real switching decisions."><figcaption>Medium shot of a conference room table with printed runbooks, highlighters, and a laptop showing a one‑line diagram. Three utility engineers point to a section labeled Restoration Steps. The room has neutral walls, a glass board with sticky notes arranged by scenario, and soft daylight from a side window. Coffee cups and safety vests on chair backs hint at field‑ready practicality.</figcaption></figure><p>Bring the pieces together with a short, staged plan: fix the data, automate the edges, and drill the playbook. Use clear metrics that map to SAIDI and SAIFI, but also track the upstream indicators that make those numbers move. When each improvement is paired with a defined baseline and an operational owner, reliability gains become repeatable rather than accidental.</p></article></main><footer class="container" itemscope itemtype="https://schema.org/Organization"><hr /><!-- — Site-wide nav links (SEO-friendly) — --><nav aria-label="Footer navigation" itemscope itemtype="https://schema.org/SiteNavigationElement"><ul style="list-style:none; padding-left:0; margin:0; display:flex; flex-wrap:wrap; gap:.65rem;"><li itemprop="name"><a href="https://github.com/michaelwoods53/PulseGeek/about/" itemprop="url">About</a></li><li itemprop="name"><a href="https://github.com/michaelwoods53/PulseGeek/contact/" itemprop="url">Contact</a></li><li itemprop="name"><a href="https://github.com/michaelwoods53/PulseGeek/privacy/" itemprop="url">Privacy&nbsp;Policy</a></li><li itemprop="name"><a href="https://github.com/michaelwoods53/PulseGeek/terms/" itemprop="url">Terms&nbsp;of&nbsp;Service</a></li><li itemprop="name"><a href="https://github.com/michaelwoods53/PulseGeek/site-map/" itemprop="url">HTML&nbsp;Sitemap</a></li><li itemprop="name"><a href="https://github.com/michaelwoods53/PulseGeek/rss.xml" itemprop="url" title="RSS 2.0 feed">RSS&nbsp;Feed</a></li><li itemprop="name"><a href="https://github.com/michaelwoods53/PulseGeek/atom.xml" itemprop="url" title="Atom 1.0 feed">Atom</a></li><li itemprop="name"><a href="https://github.com/michaelwoods53/PulseGeek/feed.json" itemprop="url" title="JSON Feed 1.1">JSON&nbsp;Feed</a></li></ul></nav><!-- — Copyright — --><small style="display:block; margin-top:.75rem;"> © 2025 <span itemprop="name">PulseGeek</span>.
